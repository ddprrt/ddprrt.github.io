Here's a couple of resources that help you getting more out of TypeScript and React:

- [TypeScript's React + Webpack pages](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/react-&-webpack.html). The get started guide from the official website
- [Microsoft's React + TypeScript Quick Start](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-React-Starter#typescript-react-starter). A quick-start package setting everything up so you can get going with your project!
- [Next.js TypeScript plugin](https://github.com/zeit/next-plugins/tree/master/packages/next-typescript). I almost exclusively use React with Next.js. Check out this plugin, it makes TypeScript integration super easy.
- [Martin Hochel's blog posts](https://medium.com/@martin_hotell). I learned everything about React + TypeScript from Martin. Check out his articles, they're brilliant.
- [ScriptCast episode on TypeScript + React](https://javascript-podcast.com/podcast/16). Recorded with Martin. Check it out!
- [Building Scalable, Maintainable Apps Using React and TypeScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owcuEwn-pSM). A pretty good talk by Kamran Ayub on that topic.
- [Ali Sharif's notes on TypeScript](https://dev.to/busypeoples). Excellent insights into some inner workings of complex types.

If you have more, let me know!
