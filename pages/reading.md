A list of articles and books I've read. And liked! Also, check out my [watching list](/watching-list).

## January 2019

- [Today, the Trident era ends](https://schepp.dev/posts/today-the-trident-era-ends/) by Schepp. A historical analysis of all the innovations Internet Explorer brought on the table. I think it's quite curious that people can develop hate towards products, so it's nice to see that somebody praises a browser that revolutionized the Internet in many ways. And it's not just *somebody*, it's Schepp. He's not only the best podcast buddy in the world but also a master in cross-browser polyfilling. Something that we did back in the day. Great work, Schepp!

- [The wrong Abstraction](https://www.sandimetz.com/blog/2016/1/20/the-wrong-abstraction) by Sandi Metz. Great piece on how we often do abstractions for abstraction's sake. They come at a cost. Duplication is ok if it supports a more flexible architecture.

- [Steve Jobs: The Exclusive Biography](https://www.amazon.de/Steve-Jobs-Exclusive-Walter-Isaacson/dp/034914043X). I read it over the Christmas holidays and remembered how much I enjoyed the iPod. I had 4 models of it, and each was super dear to me. It was truly a personal device. This book also explained why some CEOs I knew turned into assholes in 2012. 

I stole the idea from [Manuel Matuzovic](https://www.matuzo.at/readinglist/) -- great idea, buddy!
