A list of articles and books I've read. And liked!

## January 2019

- [The wrong Abstraction](https://www.sandimetz.com/blog/2016/1/20/the-wrong-abstraction) by Sandi Metz. Great piece on how we often do abstractions for abstraction's sake. They come at a cost. Duplication is ok if it supports a more flexible architecture.

- [Steve Jobs: The Exclusive Biography](https://www.amazon.de/Steve-Jobs-Exclusive-Walter-Isaacson/dp/034914043X). Read it over the Christmas holidays and remembered how much I enjoyed the iPod. I had 4 models of it, and each was super dear to me. It was truly a personal device. This book also explained why some CEOs I knew turned into assholes in 2012. 

The idea is totally stolen from [Manuel Matuzovic](https://www.matuzo.at/readinglist/) -- great idea, buddy!
