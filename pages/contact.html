<p>I'm Stefan Baumgartner, I'm a web developer/web lover based in Linz, Austria. Currently I'm employed at <a href="https://dynatrace.com">Dynatrace</a>, making the web a faster place. I'm also co-host at the German <a href="http://www.workingdraft.de">Workingdraft</a> podcast.</p>

<p class="img-holder"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Foto-02.05.12-10-54-33.jpg"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Foto-02.05.12-10-54-33-220x300.jpg" alt="@ddprrt" width="220" height="300" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-221" /></a></p>

<h2>ddprrt? What the ...?</h2>

<p>My Twitter/Github/Whatever handle is "ddprrt", which is very, very short for "dead parrot". If you don't know what dead parrot is all about, check out <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vuW6tQ0218">this video on YouTube</a>. Yeah, it's all about Monty Python! </p>

<h2>Contact</h2>

<p>If you want to get in touch with me, just shoot an <a href="mailto:stefan@scriptconf.org">E-Mail</a>, or just shoot a <a href="http://twitter.com/ddprrt">tweet</a>. I'm happy to answer to any issue as soon as I can!</p>
