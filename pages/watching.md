A list of conference talks I've watched, and liked! Also check out my [reading list](/reading-list)

## January 2019

- [Write accessible Go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVaDY0ChvOQ) by Julia Ferraioli. I love accessibility talks, especially some that go into totally different directions. This one by Julia is about writing code that's better to experience for people who with visual impairments. I love this talk! Especially since the old rule prevails: If your product (in this case: your code) is accessible for everyone, also people wihtout impairments benefit from it. Good coding guidelines never fail. Julia also does a brilliant delivery. Kudos!
