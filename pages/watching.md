A list of conference talks I've watched, and liked! Also, check out my [reading list](/reading-list)

## January 2019

- [The return of "Write Less, Do more"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzX4aTRPzno) by Rich Harris. The only introduction to Svelte that you ever need. And holy template compiler, Batman! Rich is a fantastic storyteller. The amount of detail he puts into his talks is astounding. His delivery feels like watching JavaScript fairy tales. Astounding!

- [Polly wants a message](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtROlyWWhV0) by Sandi Metz. Sandi shows why object-oriented code doesn't have to be a nightmare. I usually don't do a lot of OO, but this one still got me. 

- [Building a resilient front-end architecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqfbAXCCVwE) by Monica Lent. I deal with a lot of software architecture these days, reading tons of articles and books, and most of them are over-blown, over-complicated, and quite arrogant views on Software Engineering. Not Monica. Monica gives a fun, engaging, and immensely useful talk on architecture. Tips that you can put to use immediately. I could listen to her for lots more hours, I have the feeling that she just started sharing her architecture knowledge.

- [Write accessible Go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVaDY0ChvOQ) by Julia Ferraioli. I love accessibility talks, especially some that go into totally different directions. This one by Julia is about writing code that's better to experience for people with visual impairments. I love this talk! Especially since the old rule prevails: If your product (in this case: your code) is accessible for everyone, also people without impairments benefit from it. Good coding guidelines never fail. Julia also does a brilliant delivery. Kudos!
