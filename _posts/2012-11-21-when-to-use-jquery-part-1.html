jQuery is a blast! It has a very easy to understand and mighty API, plus it does us web developers a big favour: It fixes years of DOM raping with one handy interface. Getting into jQuery is very easy, and even if you don't have that much experience in software development or programming in general, you will get good results very fast. 

However, jQuery's biggest advantage is also it's greatest flaw. As easily as you can create something, you can also destroy a browser's performance by not knowing what you are actually doing. jQuery is a beast, and this little series will show some examples and situations, where it isn't always the right choice.

There are plenty of jQuery performance tutorials out there, <a href="http://addyosmani.com/jqprovenperformance/" target="_blank">Addy Osmani</a> released a very good overview once, so this series will focus on mobile browsers, which are known for their mostly slow Javascript engines. (But most of the conclusions also apply to the Desktop, when considering modern browsers).

<h2>Habits and Facts</h2>

For starters we have to establish some facts and goals. We will consider how we developed with jQuery in the past, and how does the new environment of mobiles browsers react to our habits of coding?

The answer to the first question is easy: jQuery was designed to easily select nodes (elements) from our DOM and manipulate them in any way possible. Mostly we will add new content or manipulate existing one by changing contents and/or their display status in any way thinkable (hiding, showing, animating to different style properties. Mostly we use jQuery for those tasks:

<ol>
	<li>selecting elements, often using advanced selectors (<strong>Selecting</strong>)</li>
	<li>traversing through the DOM by having an element as starting point (<strong>Traversing</strong>)</li>
	<li>changing the visibility or visual features of an element (<strong>Manipulation</strong>)</li>
	<li>listen to browser events and execute code on events (<strong>Events</strong>)</li>
	<li>retrieving content asynchronously (<strong>AJAX</strong>)</li>
</ol>

In most cases you need to complete several tasks at the same time. Think of an example, where once you click a button (Events) you retrieve a filter id using an AJAX call (AJAX) and you have to hide some elements accordingly or change their contents (Selecting, Manipulation).  

Considering mobile environments, we might recall some basic Javascript facts we just love to ignore when we're developing on a desktop, but which are essential on mobile browsers:

<ul>
	<li>DOM Manipulation costs, no matter how small this manipulation might be.</li>
	<li>Javascript still is a script language (hence the name) and will not be executed in a compiled form. So every line of code you are going to use will be executed and interpreted. This also includes some pitfalls, as more lines doesn't necessarily mean more execution time. A more complex basic operation can cost more than an easy operation splitted up. Take this <a href="http://jsperf.com/demo-ddprrt" target="_blank">jsPerf</a> as an example. We're talking peanuts here, tough.</li>
	<li>For mobile browsers: Javascript is SLOW! And with slow I mean it's horrific. I long considered the Mobile Safari 5.1 on the iPad 2 being the fastest Javascript Engine on mobile devices (newer apple products might be even faster). But still, my Chrome on a 2011 Macbook Pro can do eight times the operations compared to my 2011 iPads. And I haven't even talked about less sophisticated browsers like those native webkit browsers on Android 2.x phones</li>
</ul>

<h2>How those habits suck</h2>

With this in mind, I'd like to show you a somewhat abbreviated example of a real world application, developed before those smartphones were even considered for browsing the web. We got a call from a customer who said that his product filter didn't work quite well on the iPad, since the filter checkboxes were overall slow and didn't respond to our fingers. We spent quite some time on talking a look on the checkboxes before even thinking of looking at the operation behind. This was (in some way) the original code:

<pre><code class="language-javascript">
$('input.checkbox').click(function(e) {
  e.preventDefault();
  var code = $(this).val();
  $('.elements').each(function() {
    if($(this).attr('codes').indexOf(code) >= 0) {
      $(this).hide();
    }
  });
});
</code></pre>

The real example was somewhat more complex, but this here is sufficient to show what's the deal: You click on a checkbox (Event), and run through all elements checking if the selected code is in a code-list (which is done in a rather bad way by not using the HTML5 data-attributes, but hey, this happened 2008 or 2009), and if so, hide it (Manipulation). Yeah, even if you cache the element, this was still slow on the iPad using jQuery 1.4.

First we made our usual performance optimisations: Caching objects, dropping the each-Method and using a for-loop instead, and so on. Still sucked. What we realised after taking a deeper look into all those functions: the real bottleneck was hiding the elements with jQueries hide method. With <code class="language-javascript">.hide()</code> you have the ability to do a hiding animation as well, and with older jQuery versions this animation was still standard. But even if we set the duration to zero, the hiding method was the breaker for the performance on the iPad. 

Why? Because it changed 200 elements in our tree synchronously and by adding different style attributes over time. Changing this to a special <code class="language-css">.hidden { display: none; }</code> class did the same job alot faster.
