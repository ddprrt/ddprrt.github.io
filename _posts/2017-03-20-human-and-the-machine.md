Back in the day I was an avid reader of [The pastry box](https://the-pastry-box-project.net/). You can imagine how super happy I was when Alex, the project's creator asked me to contribute to his new project [Human and the machine](https://superyesmore.com/publication/the-human-in-the-machine-a4064599cde2cb3397239e8d72219f48). It's all about productivity, in all shapes and forms imaginable. I wrote about "[getting the gist](https://superyesmore.com/get-the-gist-8ff35dc28f30640e2d5fd54bcb7ff083)", and how I manage to stay up to date without having to become an expert myself. Contributing was a wonderful experience, thanks again to Alex for having me and for this great opportunity!
