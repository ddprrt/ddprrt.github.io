So, Linz has a software conference. One that's supposed to stay. I think it's
about time. Linz has a wonderful IT community, with lots of great companies and
so many schools and universities specialised for software development. With the
exception of the short-lived Kod.io movement (spanning [Kod.io](/blog/2014/03/02/kodio/),
Codefront and Railsgirls in 2014), as well as some Linuxwochen every now and then,
I hardly can remember any full-fledged Software conference.
So hey, we finally got one!

Usually I would give some sort of review. But as I was partly involved with
the conference's organisation, I decided to put a little twist on the usual
review you would expect. As people recognised my involvement, they asked me
a lot of questions around the conference inbetween sessions. I gathered (or
rather: remembered) the few questions attendees asked me the most.

## Why did you organise the Austrian Topconf in Linz?

First of all: I'm not the organiser. Chris Frei from Topconf is, I'm "just" in
the program committee. This put me in a wonderful position of being able to
wish for incredible speakers and create some wonderful tracks. When I see
Ben Reitzammer say [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/benjamin/status/695150175094988800)
that *"Your program committee did really great work to put together a diverse program
& set of speakers! Very well done!"**, I feel both flattered and happy.

How Topconf came to Linz was partly my fault. I spoke at [Topconf Tallinn back in 2013](http://fettblog.eu/blog/2013/11/13/topconf-tallinn-2013/).
Chris Frei wanted to expand from Estonia to other countries in Europe and asked
me where to organise one in Vienna, and which companies to contact. I quickly could
convince him that I just know about the IT scene in Linz, and that Linz would
also be a good place to have a conference. I quickly gathered some people who
would join the program committee, and that's how it came to be.

Some attendees said that it "was about time" that Linz got its own conference.
And I think they are right.

## How did you get Harry Roberts to speak?!?!

I asked. And since he's really a nice guy, he actually came! Same goes for
Kahlil Lechelt, Henning Glatter-Götz, Rachel Andrew, Eva-Lotta Lamm, Phil Nash,
and Mario Heiderich. And I'm so incredibly thankful that they all agreed to join.
They are fantastic speakers and brought real value to our little event. Lots
of attendees really appreciated having them at the conference.

This goes also for Tim Perry, Alessandro Canessa and Martin Naumann who joined
through our Call for Papers. So much valuable content and so much fun having you guys here.

## Seriously, what happened with the catering?

It was quite a catastrophe, wasn't it. Well, those are the parts where **not**
being an organiser really sucks. Honestly, I don't know what happened. We had
a great catering service first, but for *some* reasons they had to drop out on
short notice. About 8 days before the event. And I still don't know why.
The alternative would've been two days and one night of McDonalds. This was the
first time where the program committee, especially Lisi, David and me, were dead
against.

What came then wasn't much better. Instead of two days, one night, we got one
night and some rather effortless alternative delivered by the venue. Heavy meaty.
I would have loved some progressively enhanced food: Vegetarian first, meat as an
extra.

We will definitely take care of this issue the next time. With Chris not being
a Linzer, it's hard for him to get to the right addresses on his own. We will hook
him up with the right people to get some proper and delicious food the next time.

The beer was excellent, though.

## Cool, any last words?

Yes. A lot of "thank you"s. Thanks to my wonderful colleagues who made this
event possible: Jürgen, Tom, Lisi, David, Andi, Bräusi and Wirthi.

The wonderful speakers who came: Eva-Lotta, Harry, Rachel, Tim, Martin, Mario,
Phil, Alessandro, Henning and Kahlil.

My former client "BGT", who sponsored the event and had some great time with us.
Also to my current employer Dynatrace who sponsored, and all my colleagues who came to the event.
Speaking to you inbetween sessions was valuable and immediate feedback to react quickly.

All the attendees who joined us at the conference, at lunch, at the bars. Seeing
you all engage in wonderful discussions and having so much fun together was constantly
telling me: Totally worth it. Glad that you enjoyed being here.

And last, but not least: To Chris and Laura. Thank you for expanding to Linz. On 2017!
