So i had the task of creating some sort of "responsive add-on" to our company's website at <a href="http://www.netural.com">Netural</a>. Those tasks I usually do on my own, because the effort going into that cannot be estimated before. It was about 4 hours. And I'm pretty happy with the result, despite it being the thing no developer wants: an old webpage "modernized".

Here's how I approached it:

First of all, the code to this webpage was at least 4 years old. So plenty of pixel-loving and IE6/IE7 hotfixing. Furthermore, each design template (talking PSDs now) got its own sort of "namespace" once it was translated into CSS. Which meant: And ID per template.

The reason behind that was obvious: let the one template not interfere with the other one, and let the CSS files be organized in at least "some" way. But this also meant: Lot's of code reproduction, nothing DRY at all. Gladly enough, the main grid was not part of that, but several forms were.

Anyways, rather rapid steps to achieve the goal:

<h2>1. Percentage all the things!</h2>

Easy: You have a wrapper holding all the elements together, so the elements inside don't need pixels anymore. Just change your grids to flexible units (like percents). Also, change the width property of your wrapper to max-width. 

<pre><code class="language-css">
.wrapper {
  margin: 0 auto;
  max-width: 960px; /* was: width */
}

.grid-main {
  width: 60%; /* was: 576px; */
  float: left;
}

.grid-side {
  width: 40%; /* was: 384px; */
  float: left;
}
</code></pre>
