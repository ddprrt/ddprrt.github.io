This is a somewhat personal post today. I'm currently in Las Vegas (which would be a story on its own) to
speak and attend our company's [Perform conference](https://www.dynatrace.com/perform). Why me, as a mere
web developer with no customer contact? First, I do like to bring the developer's view into the whole mix.
Second, I want to see the birth of a new product feature.

What is my role in this part? Well, I came to Dynatrace almost two years ago. And with every job switch you 
have a lot of expectations and also your own personal agenda you bring with you. Back in the day I was strongly
advocating metrics like Speed Index and visually complete ([I still do](/speed-index-explained-topconf/)).
Metrics that our products did not feature back then, but would have helped me a lot in my daily work. 
And I was nagging a lot. And complaining a lot. And teasing the right people ... alot! 

I almost felt if I'm not welcome because of my attitude (being a bit cocky at times), but I was 
totally wrong. My colleagues just loved to have a new challenge! Now, almost 2 years later, we not
only have [Speed Index and visually complete](https://www.dynatrace.com/capabilities/digital-experience-monitoring/visually-complete/) available in
our products. Not only that, but we have it available through real user monitoring as an industry first.

And this is what I totally love about this company. I am able to work with the brightest minds and really
innovate something. Pushing the boundaries of what's possible and seeing those clever people putting their minds
together to create a simple as well as powerful solution for getting real user speed index is one of the 
best experiences I had so far. When I got the demo about 4 months ago, I was in awe on what my colleagues have
achieved.

I won't go into the details here, the product page and [this blog post](https://www.dynatrace.com/blog/visually-complete-speed-index-for-real-user-monitoring-rum/) are doing that.
I just wanted to say that I'm happy :-) (and maybe a little proud).
