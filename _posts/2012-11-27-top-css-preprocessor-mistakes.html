<h2>Wrong use of variables</h2>

<p>Honestly, variables was the first reason I did even take a look into preprocessors in the first place. And I'm sure I'm not the only one there. Still I thinkt those are one of Sass/LESS strongest features and variables are here even better handled than in the current CSS specification, which seems overly complicated even if it's very powerful. </p>

<p>But then, even this small feature can be misused in a very unforgiving way, and I almost freaked out when I found this codebit:</p>

{% highlight css %}
$green:  #88b83b;
$grey:   #505050;
$h1-3:   #444;
$text:   #444;
$violet: #5c1c70;
$red:    #d73a41;
{% endhighlight %}

<p>This is just amazing, since it lacks any semantics whatsoever. Alright, one might argue that it is okay giving $text and $h1-3 a certain color, but then please just give it a name which is somewhat describing. <code class="language-css">$headline-color: #444;</code> would be nice, since you could use it also with other headlines. <code class="language-css">$text</code> would be nice as <code class="language-css">$standard-text-color</code>, so you might notice that it is a <em>color</em> to begin with. </p>

<p>But what's absolutely catastrophical is the declaration of the other colors in this snipplet. Imagine having a nice <code class="language-sass">$green</code> layout and suddenly changing everything to babyblue. You still would have your <code class="language-sass">$green</code> declarations all over your preprocessor CSS files, but the meaning would be already different. Change it to <code class="language-sass">$base-ci-color</code> or something like that.</p>

<p>If you find it easier to give colors of a certain brand style guide a name like green, grey, whatsoever, define a position with colors in your preprocessor CSS file, and then using describtive variables, e.g.:</p>

{% highlight css %}
/** CI COLORS **/
$green:  #88b83b;
$red:    #d73a41;
$violet: #5c1c70;

/** global color variables **/
$default-brand-color:    $green;
$emphazised-brand-color: $red;
$default-link-color:     $green;

a, a:visited {
	color: $default-link-color;
}

h1, .h1 {
	color: $green;
}

...
{% endhighlight %}
