We successfully set up the projector in our last [chapter](/streaming-your-meetup-part-1-projector/).
Now it's time to record the speaker himself. I'll show you a couple of options how you can record
the speaker video. It's up to your budget and up to the quality you want to achieve. 

Maybe you are already into photography and have nice DSLR at home. This might totally do for recording
the speaker video. Even better: This might acutally be the best option. 

So check out how to record and stream your speaker, and be sure to check out the other parts as well:

1. [Basics and Projector](/streaming-your-meetup-part-1-projector/)
2. Recording the speaker -- üìç*you are here*
3. Recording audio -- *coming soon*
4. Directing and streaming with OBS -- *coming soon*

Let's go!

## A few words before we start

The different options I show you are category based. I don't have a favourite model or a favourite vendor.
I just select based on certain criteria. Since we want to use consumer hardware, be happy with what you have
lying around or your relatives can offer. Other than that, I always go for something affordable.

There's two things to keep in mind:

1. Camera audio always sucks. We don't want to record camera audio, that's why we check on audio in the next
   chapter. If you have to choose between two cameras that are similar in pricing, quality and features, always go
   for the camera that has an **external** microphone input. They exist, but are rare. It's always better to connect
   your audio input directly with the cam, rather than mixing it on your laptop.
2. Not every camera has the possibility to be connected to your laptop. Most of them have HDMI out to be connected
   to a monitor or to your TV screen. There's a solution for that, and you know it already from the last chapter:
   [CamLink](https://amzn.to/2K3NiNX). I bought a second one just for our cams. Also: never connect two CamLinks to
   the same USB port. Use two different ones, because they use all the power they need.

With every option you get, you'll also see info for those two criterias:

1. Is an external microphone possible
2. Do you need CamLink

Also, you most likely need a [Tripod](https://amzn.to/2OqUpoK). This one costs roughly 30 EUR.

Ready? Let's check our first option.

## The webcam

Who would have thought, a simple Webcam does the trick. Those things are not as popular anymore since
every notebook has one built-in, but they still exist and are of great quality.

One that is very popular with streamers is the [Logitech C920](https://amzn.to/30PFwh6). Great video quality,
plug and play, extra software to fine-tune it. My friend Tom uses it to stream meetups, check out one 
[of the recordings on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMfM7cV49Ts). Keep in mind that you have to be
very close to the speaker to get a proper video.

The camera costs around 100 EUR, but sometimes it's sold for around 70 EUR.

The best thing: IT FITS ON A TRIPOD! Yes! Probably the only webcam I know that fits perfectly well on a
regular Tripod.
