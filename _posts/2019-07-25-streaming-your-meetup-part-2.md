We successfully set up the projector in our last [chapter](/streaming-your-meetup-part-1-projector/).
Now it's time to record the speaker himself. I'll show you a couple of options how you can record
the speaker video. It's up to your budget and up to the quality you want to achieve. 

![Recording with a camera](/wp-content/uploads/2019/streaming-5.jpg)

Maybe you are already into photography and have nice DSLR at home. This might totally do for recording
the speaker video. Even better: This might acutally be the best option. 

So check out how to record and stream your speaker, and be sure to check out the other parts as well:

1. [Basics and Projector](/streaming-your-meetup-part-1-projector/)
2. Recording the speaker -- üìç*you are here*
3. [Recording audio](/streaming-your-meetup-part-2-audio/)
4. Directing and streaming with OBS -- *coming soon*

Let's go!

## A few words before we start

The different options I show you are category based. I don't have a favourite model or a favourite vendor.
I just select based on certain criteria. Since we want to use consumer hardware, be happy with what you have
lying around or your relatives can offer. Other than that, I always go for something affordable.

There's two things to keep in mind:

1. Camera audio always sucks. We don't want to record camera audio, that's why we check on audio in the next
   chapter. If you have to choose between two cameras that are similar in pricing, quality and features, always go
   for the camera that has an **external** microphone input. They exist, but are rare. It's always better to connect
   your audio input directly with the cam, rather than mixing it on your laptop.
2. Not every camera has the possibility to be connected to your laptop. Most of them have HDMI out to be connected
   to a monitor or to your TV screen. There's a solution for that, and you know it already from the last chapter:
   [CamLink](https://amzn.to/2K3NiNX). I bought a second one just for our cams. Also: never connect two CamLinks to
   the same USB port. Use two different ones, because they use all the power they need. Definitely check if your
   [camera is compatible with CamLink](https://www.elgato.com/de/gaming/cam-link/camera-check).

With every option you get, you'll also see info for those two criterias:

1. Is an external microphone possible
2. Do you need CamLink

Also, you most likely need a [Tripod](https://amzn.to/2OqUpoK). This one costs roughly 30 EUR.

Ready? Let's check our first option.

## The webcam

Who would have thought, a simple Webcam does the trick. Those things are not as popular anymore since
every notebook has one built-in, but they still exist and are of great quality.

One that is very popular with streamers is the [Logitech C920](https://amzn.to/30PFwh6). Great video quality,
plug and play, extra software to fine-tune it. My friend [Tom](https://twitter.com/tompson) uses it to stream meetups, check out one 
[of the recordings on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMfM7cV49Ts). Keep in mind that you have to be
very close to the speaker to get a proper video.

The camera costs around 100 EUR, but sometimes it's sold for around 70 EUR.

The best thing: IT FITS ON A TRIPOD! Yes! Probably the only webcam I know that can be mounted on a
regular Tripod.

## The camcorder

For my meetups we use a camcorder. We bought the [Legria HF R806](https://amzn.to/2GsPhu3), but I'm not entirely 
convinced. It's nice as it works with CamLink, but it doesn't have any external microphone input. Also, the quality
lacks when lights are dim. You can do a lot with the onboard settings, but overall, I expected a bit more. THe price
is ok. Around 250 EUR.

The cool thing is, though, that you can record hours of material next to streaming it to your laptop. Which means
I always have a video backup should anything crash on the laptop.

My friend [Rainer](https://twitter.com/rstropek) uses a [Sony FDR-AX33](https://amzn.to/2LGdlOn). This one has an audio jack for an external microphone, and the quality is supreme. It also costs a lot more, this one is sold for 500 EUR.

But hey, check out the quality in [one of Rainer's videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umJE9my_Aeg).

## The DSLR

DSLRs are not camcorders or video recorders. They are not there to record lengthy videos, and most of them
stop after 15 minutes due to some taxation issues. But: They are available. Either you or one of your relatives
could have one and they create *great* shots. 

I would not recommend buying one extra for streaming, because they are expensive. Around 500-800 EUR just
for the camera, and then you have to invest in lenses. The Canon EOS series allows for external microphones,
but is hard to use with CamLink. 

The Sony cameras (A5100, A6000) don't have an external microphone check, but work great with CamLink.
Your choice.

## The action camera

Another possibility, somewhere inbetween Camcorder and DSLR, is a [GoPro action camera](https://amzn.to/2YnHFTI). They
are affordable ([180EUR](https://amzn.to/2YpT3P1) to 350 EUR), and have great accessories. There's an adapter for [10 EUR for an external microphone](https://amzn.to/2OiwF6t).

The video is not typically conference like, but you might like that.

## The iPhone

There's another possibility that has popped up: The iPhone. Elgato (the people behind CamLink), released
[Stream Link for 11 EUR](https://www.elgato.com/de/gaming/screen-link). This, together with the [Game Capture Studio](https://www.elgato.com/de/gaming/game-capture-software) allows you to stream your iPhone camera (or screen!) to your
PC. It requires *great* WiFi, thought. Don't be fooled, it's nowhere as stable as good old plugs. But it might be an
option if your laptop hardware and the WiFi you have is strong enough to support this. And: an external microphone is
possible. Great!

Other than that: There's a possibility to connect your phone with CamLink and use it as a camera. Sweet.

## Summary

Lots of options, all of them good, all of them different. They might suit your situation or your
budget, or you might not produce the results you wish to achieve. Make sure the hardware selected is
suitable for your everyday need.

If you don't use an external webcam, almost all solutions are able to have an external microphone
(if you select the right model), and need CamLink. They differ in quality, budget, and availability.

This is the setup so far:

![The streaming setup](/wp-content/uploads/2019/streaming-6.png)

- 2 extra HDMI cables (we assume that there is one available from the projector)
- An HDMI splitter
- 1-2 CamLinks
- A webcam (or similar)
- Your streaming notebook


## Money spent so far

You have a ton of options that are all cheaper than a pro camera. But they produce different results. If you do a
lot of streaming, I'd recommend investing in a Sony camcorder with an external microphone jack, and CamLink. Another CamLink costs another 130 EUR. Don't forget to add that amount to your calculations.
If you are for the most affordable one, let's buy a Logitech Webcam on sale and a tripod:

- [Tripod (Amazon)](https://amzn.to/2OqUpoK): 30 EUR
- [Logitech C920](https://amzn.to/30PFwh6): 70 EUR on sale

100 EUR. Together with 190 EUR from the first chapter, we spent **290 EUR** to stream.
