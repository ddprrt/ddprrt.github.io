I had the incredible privilege to work with the fine folks at [A List Apart](https://www.alistapart.com) on a text concerning resource bundling in the age of HTTP/2. Using the powers of the new protocol is something that keeps my head busy [for quite some time now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98z0XjYWX0o), and I had to write down my findings. Aaron and Jeremy from ALA were kind enough to accept this piece and work with me on it. It's been a very thorough process, but it strengthens my belief that an editor's work can't be valued enough. Thanks for all your help in getting this one out!

I hope you enjoy reading [The Best Request Is No Request, Revisited](https://alistapart.com/article/the-best-request-is-no-request-revisited) as much as I enjoyed writing it. And if you stop by, please pay some attention to the awesome artwork by [Dougal McPherson](https://twitter.com/mrdougal).
