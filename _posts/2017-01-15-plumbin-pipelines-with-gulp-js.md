Now that [my book](https://manning.com/baumgartner) is out, I dug up an old workshop I held almost one and a half years ago in Belgium at Devoxx. Devoxx is a special type of conference, unlike any other conference I've ever seen. And speaking at a cinema definitely is one of the things that get stuck with you. Anyways, here's the 2 hour course (the rest of the show is a little off topic, intentionally), which is about 75% of the Gulp chapters in live coding.
Enjoy:

And of course, there are some slides available. You can also find them on [Speakerdeck](https://speakerdeck.com/ddprrt/plumbin-pipelines-with-gulp-dot-js-3hr-workshop).

As said before, this the nitty gritty, the gist. Some programming patterns, while the full deal is available in my book at [Manning](http://bit.ly/gulp-tool-book).
