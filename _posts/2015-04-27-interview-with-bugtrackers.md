I had the sincere pleasure of doing an interview with the guys at <a href="https://www.bugtrackers.io/interview-stefan-baumgartner">bugtrackers.io</a>. We talked a lot about my journey as a web developer for the last 15 years. Starting as a teenage boy doing <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040403201325/http://www.squarenet.de/main.php?site=sn-news">Gaming websites</a>, up to creating websites professionally with several agencies, and finally my landing at <a href="http://www.ruxit.com">Ruxit</a>.

If you ever wondered what Final Fantasy, Leisure Suit Larry, Application Performance Management, Dentist materials and formwork experts have in common, go and have a look at <a href="https://www.bugtrackers.io/interview-stefan-baumgartner">bugtrackers.io</a>.

Thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/tompeham">Thomas</a> for the nice interview! I surely did enjoy it a lot!
