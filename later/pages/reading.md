A list of articles and books I've read. And liked! Also, check out my [watching list](/watching-list).

## March 20

- [JavaScript: The first 20 years](https://zenodo.org/record/3707008#.XnXvDpP0nyg) by Allen Wirfs-Brock and Brendan Eich. The creator of JavaScript details the first 20 years in over 190 pages. Wow. Use your self-isolation to browse through this over the week-end.

## February 2020

- [Keeping it simple with CSS that scales](https://hankchizljaw.com/wrote/keeping-it-simple-with-css-that-scales/) by Andy Bell. Extensive read on CSS best practices and how everything has been there already and doesn't need to be re-invented. I'm not sure if I agree with all of it, but most of it resonates very well with me. I also think more people should publish written versions of their talks.

- [Stateful Serverless](https://www.swyx.io/writing/stateful-serverless/) by Swyx. Good explanation on cold start / warm start and state of serverless functions. With examples!

## January 2020

- [Today, the Trident era ends](https://schepp.dev/posts/today-the-trident-era-ends/) by Schepp. A historical analysis of all the innovations Internet Explorer brought on the table. I think it's quite curious that people can develop hate towards products, so it's nice to see that somebody praises a browser that revolutionized the Internet in many ways. And it's not just *somebody*, it's Schepp. He's not only the best podcast buddy in the world but also a master in cross-browser polyfilling. Something that we did back in the day. Great work, Schepp!

- [The wrong Abstraction](https://www.sandimetz.com/blog/2016/1/20/the-wrong-abstraction) by Sandi Metz. Great piece on how we often do abstractions for abstraction's sake. They come at a cost. Duplication is ok if it supports a more flexible architecture.

- [Steve Jobs: The Exclusive Biography](https://www.amazon.de/Steve-Jobs-Exclusive-Walter-Isaacson/dp/034914043X). I read it over the Christmas holidays and remembered how much I enjoyed the iPod. I had 4 models of it, and each was super dear to me. It was truly a personal device. This book also explained why some CEOs I knew turned into assholes in 2012. 

I stole the idea from [Manuel Matuzovic](https://www.matuzo.at/readinglist/) -- great idea, buddy!
