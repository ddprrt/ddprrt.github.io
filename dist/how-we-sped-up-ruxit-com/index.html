&lt;p&gt;The first time I wrote something for my new Job at &lt;a href=&quot;https://ruxit.com&quot;&gt;Ruxit.com&lt;/a&gt;. We spent about three weeks to push the site’s loading performance to a possible max, without us having the possibility to reduce the page’s weight. &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.ruxit.com/how-we-sped-up-ruxit-com/&quot;&gt;This is the write-up of our endeavour&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
