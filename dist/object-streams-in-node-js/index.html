    <p>I’m really good friends with the people at Rising Stack in Budapest. I had lots of fun when they invited me to JSConf Budapest back in May, and enjoy every time they show up here in Linz! I’m also looking forward to see them again when Peter will talk at the upcoming <a href="https://devone.at">Devone</a> conference. So it’s clear that I was more than eager to produce a guest post for their <a href="https://community.risingstack.com">Rising Stack community</a>. Even though I was so eager, it took me roughly 3 months to produce an article based on my recent book “Front-End tooling”. Nevertheless, I thought that my guide to object streams turned out pretty good! I hope <a href="https://community.risingstack.com/the-definitive-guide-to-object-streams-in-node-js/">you enjoy it</a>!</p>
