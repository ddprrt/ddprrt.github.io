    <p>I enjoy being at conferences, however I can’t be on all of them. Which is sad,<br>
because judging from all the videos one misses a lot! Turns out, my most<br>
favorite talks were all from conferences I haven’t been to. The organizers<br>
however are kind enough to provide amazing videos for us:</p>
<h2>Jake Archibald: Modern Progressive Enhancement</h2>
<p>Jake Archibald gives a wonderful and funny performance showing the manifold<br>
advantages his latest brain-child has to offer: Service Workers. This thing will<br>
most likely be one of the new best practices we have to incorporate in every<br>
website from now on.</p>

<h2>Vasilis van Gemert: Look, no mediaqueries!</h2>
<p>“Look, no mediaqueries” is a way to humble title for this talk. Vasilis shows<br>
individual and fresh layout techniques which can be a achieved with a few lines of<br>
CSS. This goes way beyond the boring stereotypical website layout we see every day.<br>
Still, his techniques are so universally usable that you might incorporate them in<br>
any layout challenge you might face.</p>

<h2>Franziska Hinkelmann: A Trip to the Zoo: SpiderMonkey, SquirrelFish, Nashorn, V8</h2>
<p>Franziska gives wonderful insights on how JavaScript engines work under the hood. With<br>
lots and lots of demos she shows how subtle changes in code can make a big difference<br>
in execution.</p>

<h2>Kornel Lesiński: And .then() what? Promise programming patterns</h2>
<p>In his talk, Kornel shows that Promises are not only good for avoiding the dreaded<br>
callback hell, but also allow for some sweet programming patterns. Being able to “work”<br>
with values that haven’t arrived yet makes our code much more robust and flexible.</p>
