&lt;p&gt;Now that &lt;a href=&quot;https://manning.com/baumgartner&quot;&gt;my book&lt;/a&gt; is out, I dug up an old workshop I held almost one and a half years ago in Belgium at Devoxx. Devoxx is a special type of conference, unlike any other conference I’ve ever seen. And speaking at a cinema definitely is one of the things that get stuck with you. Anyways, here’s the 2 hour course (the rest of the show is a little off topic, intentionally), which is about 75% of the Gulp chapters in live coding.&lt;br&gt;
Enjoy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course, there are some slides available. You can also find them on &lt;a href=&quot;https://speakerdeck.com/ddprrt/plumbin-pipelines-with-gulp-dot-js-3hr-workshop&quot;&gt;Speakerdeck&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As said before, this the nitty gritty, the gist. Some programming patterns, while the full deal is available in my book at &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/gulp-tool-book&quot;&gt;Manning&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
