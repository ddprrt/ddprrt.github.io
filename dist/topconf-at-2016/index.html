    <p>So, Linz has a software conference. One that’s supposed to stay. I think it’s<br>
about time. Linz has a wonderful IT community, with lots of great companies and<br>
so many schools and universities specialised for software development. Except for the short-lived <a href="http://Kod.io">Kod.io</a> movement (spanning <a href="/blog/2014/03/02/kodio/">Kod.io</a>,<br>
Codefront and Railsgirls in 2014), as well as some Linuxwochen now and then,<br>
I hardly can remember any full-fledged Software conference.<br>
So hey, we finally got one!</p>
<p>Usually I would give some sort of review. But as I was partly involved with<br>
the conference’s organisation, I decided to put a little twist on the usual<br>
review you would expect. As people recognised my involvement, they asked me<br>
a lot of questions around the conference in-between sessions. I gathered (or<br>
rather: remembered) the few questions attendees asked me the most.</p>
<h2>Why did you organise the Austrian Topconf in Linz?</h2>
<p>First of all: I’m not the organiser. Chris Frei from Topconf is, I’m “just” in<br>
the program committee. This put me in a wonderful position of being able to<br>
wish for incredible speakers and create some wonderful tracks. When I see<br>
Ben Reitzammer say <a href="https://twitter.com/benjamin/status/695150175094988800">on Twitter</a><br>
that <em>“Your program committee did really great work to put together a diverse program<br>
&amp; set of speakers! Very well done!”</em>, I feel both flattered and happy.</p>
<p>How Topconf came to Linz was partly my fault. I spoke at <a href="http://fettblog.eu/blog/2013/11/13/topconf-tallinn-2013/">Topconf Tallinn back in 2013</a>.<br>
Chris Frei wanted to expand from Estonia to other countries in Europe and asked<br>
me where to organise one in Vienna, and which companies to contact. I quickly could<br>
convince him that I just know about the IT scene in Linz, and that Linz would<br>
also be a good place to have a conference. I quickly gathered some people who<br>
would join the program committee, and that’s how it came to be.</p>
<p>Some attendees said that it “was about time” that Linz got its own conference.<br>
And I think they are right.</p>
<h2>How did you get Harry Roberts to speak?!?!</h2>
<p>I asked. And since he’s really a nice guy, he actually came! Same goes for<br>
Kahlil Lechelt, Henning Glatter-Götz, Rachel Andrew, Eva-Lotta Lamm, Phil Nash,<br>
and Mario Heiderich. And I’m so incredibly thankful that they all agreed to join.<br>
They are fantastic speakers and brought real value to our little event. Lots<br>
of attendees really appreciated having them at the conference.</p>
<p>This goes also for Tim Perry, Alessandro Canessa and Martin Naumann who joined<br>
through our Call for Papers. So much valuable content and so much fun having you guys here.</p>
<h2>Seriously, what happened with the catering?</h2>
<p>It was quite a catastrophe, wasn’t it. Well, those are the parts where <strong>not</strong><br>
being an organiser really sucks. Honestly, I don’t know what happened. We had<br>
a great catering service first, but for <em>some</em> reasons they had to drop out on<br>
short notice. About 8 days before the event. And I still don’t know why.<br>
The alternative would’ve been two days and one night of McDonalds. This was the<br>
first time where the program committee, especially Lisi, David and me, were dead<br>
against.</p>
<p>What came then wasn’t much better. Instead of two days, one night, we got one<br>
night and some rather effortless alternative delivered by the venue. Heavy meaty.<br>
I would have loved some progressively enhanced food: Vegetarian first, meat as an<br>
extra.</p>
<p>We will definitely take care of this issue the next time. With Chris not being<br>
a Linzer, it’s hard for him to get to the right addresses on his own. This is<br>
something that we from the program commitee should’ve kept an eye on. Think about<br>
you organising a conference at some place you rarely be, relying on Google and<br>
some recommendations? We will hook him up with the right people to get some proper<br>
and delicious food the next time. We already have some providers in mind.</p>
<p>The beer was excellent, though.</p>
<h2>Cool, any last words?</h2>
<p>Yes. A lot of &quot;thank you&quot;s. Thanks to my wonderful colleagues who made this<br>
event possible: Jürgen, Tom, Lisi, David, Andi, Bräusi and Wirthi.</p>
<p>The wonderful speakers who came: Eva-Lotta, Harry, Rachel, Tim, Martin, Mario,<br>
Phil, Alessandro, Henning and Kahlil.</p>
<p>My former client “BGT”, who sponsored the event and had some great time with us.<br>
My current employer Dynatrace who sponsored, and all my colleagues who came to the event.<br>
Speaking to you in-between sessions was valuable and immediate feedback to react quickly.</p>
<p>All the attendees who joined us at the conference, at lunch, at the bars. Seeing<br>
you all engage in wonderful discussions and having so much fun together was constantly<br>
telling me: Totally worth it. Glad that you enjoyed being here.</p>
<p>And last, but not least: To Chris and Laura. You put so much effort into giving<br>
our community a great event and gave us such a wonderful time.<br>
Thank you for everything. On 2017!</p>
