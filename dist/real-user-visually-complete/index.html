    <p>This is a somewhat personal post today. I’m currently in Las Vegas (which would be a story on its own) to<br>
speak and attend our company’s <a href="https://www.dynatrace.com/perform">Perform conference</a>. Why me, as a mere<br>
web developer with no customer contact? First, I do like to bring the developer’s view into the whole mix.<br>
Second, I want to see the birth of a new product feature.</p>
<p>What is my role in this part? Well, I came to Dynatrace almost two years ago. And with every job switch you<br>
have a lot of expectations and also your own personal agenda you bring with you. Back in the day I was strongly<br>
advocating metrics like Speed Index and visually complete (<a href="/speed-index-explained-topconf/">I still do</a>).<br>
Metrics that our products did not feature back then, but would have helped me a lot in my daily work.<br>
And I was nagging a lot. And complaining a lot. And teasing the right people … alot!</p>
<p>I almost felt if I’m not welcome because of my attitude (being a bit cocky at times), but I was<br>
totally wrong. My colleagues just loved to have a new challenge! Now, almost 2 years later, we have<br>
<a href="https://www.dynatrace.com/capabilities/digital-experience-monitoring/visually-complete/">Speed Index and visually complete</a> available in<br>
our products. Not only that, but we have it available through real user monitoring as an industry first.</p>
<p>And this is what I totally love about this company. I am able to work with the brightest minds and really<br>
innovate something. Pushing the boundaries of what’s possible and seeing those clever people putting their minds<br>
together to create a simple as well as powerful solution for getting real user speed index is one of the<br>
best experiences I had so far. When I got the demo about 4 months ago, I was in awe on what my colleagues have<br>
achieved.</p>

<p>I won’t go into the details here, the product page and <a href="https://www.dynatrace.com/blog/visually-complete-speed-index-for-real-user-monitoring-rum/">this blog post</a> are doing that.<br>
I just wanted to say that I’m happy :-) (and maybe a little proud).</p>
