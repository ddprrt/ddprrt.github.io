<p>Ready? Let‚Äôs go!</p>
<h2>A few words before we start</h2>
<p>For this tutorial we use <a href="https://obsproject.com/">OBS</a>, aka Open Broadcaster Software. This<br>
thing is a beast. There‚Äôs almost nothing you can‚Äôt do with OBS. I could fill pages, but this<br>
shouldn‚Äôt be an OBS guide book, rather a gentle introduction so you can get started easily.</p>
<p>There are of course other programs out there that might have a nicer user interface or are<br>
generally more intuitive to use, but OBS is free, cross-platform, can do a ton, and is totally<br>
sufficient for your videos.</p>
<p>One thing that I don‚Äôt share in this tutorial is how to operate the YouTube live studio or<br>
similar. There are just too many options out there, and especially YouTube changes look and<br>
feel way too often. I just can‚Äôt keep up with those changes.</p>
<p>I try to lead you to the correct settings you need for your YouTube stream, though.</p>
<p>Ready? Let‚Äôs go!</p>
<h2>Really important hardware settings</h2>
<p>I already spoke about it in the last parts, but here‚Äôs a quick rundown of some important<br>
hardware requirements and settings you have to take to successfully stream your meetup:</p>
<ol>
<li>Have a laptop with a proper graphics card. ATI or NVIDIA. Intel on-board is not sufficent<br>
enough for 30fps or more.</li>
<li>Make sure you plug the cameras (the projector and your speaker) to the opposite sides of<br>
your laptop. The reasoning is that the left and the right side might have different power<br>
supply. Especially CamLink is draining a lot of power, and it might crash at times if there<br>
isn‚Äôt enough.</li>
<li>Power plugged in, always.</li>
<li>If possible, go for an ethernet link rather than WiFi. Even with the best upstream WiFi can<br>
be flaky.</li>
</ol>
<p>All good? Than check out this one important software setting.</p>
<h2>One really important software setting</h2>
<p>OBS works without much hassle. You open it and everything is like you left it before. It has<br>
a ton of settings for you to fiddle around, but there is one really important setting you shouldn‚Äôt miss.</p>
<p>The original output and canvas resolution of OBS is some weird value. You want to have HD, at least.<br>
To change this, click <em>Settings</em> (button) ‚Üí <em>Video</em> (tab) and change both canvas resolution<br>
and output resolution to HD.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/streaming-11.jpg" alt="The settings screen"></p>
<p>Now you can start designing your scenes.</p>
<h2>Scenes</h2>
<p>OBS works in scenes. Think of it as different arrangements for your content. You can switch<br>
easily between scenes to get more dynamic into your live streams.</p>
<p>The scenes box is located at the bottom left of the OBS screen. With the + button you can<br>
add new screens, with - you delete them. You know how this works.</p>
<p>I usually create four different scenes:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Intro and Break</strong> This one is for the parts of the live stream where people shouldn‚Äôt<br>
see what‚Äôs going on. I usually put in a logo and some catchy background music. Royalty free<br>
of course.</li>
<li><strong>Scene</strong>. The main scene itself. This one contains all of it. Speaker video, speaker audio,<br>
logo and projector. The setup is something you usually see from conference videos.</li>
<li><strong>Speaker only</strong>. This one is a full screen capture of the speaker. Nice for parts where you<br>
don‚Äôt need a slide in your background, but where it‚Äôs more important to see how the speaker reacts.</li>
<li><strong>Projector only</strong>. Projector only is the opposite. Here we see what‚Äôs going on on screen, no<br>
distractions. I use this especially for live coding parts.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can switch between scenes by clicking on them. If you want to have keyboard shortcuts, go to<br>
<em>Settings</em> ‚Üí <em>Hot Keys</em> and assign shortcuts at every <em>Switch to scene</em> entry.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/streaming-12.jpg" alt="The scenes box"></p>
<p>The scenes are set, now we add the sources.</p>
<h2>Sources</h2>
<p>Sources are, well, the input sources for your live stream. This can also be anything. Starting<br>
from everything we have attached to the laptop over to images, pre-recorded videos, media of<br>
any kind or simple things like colored areas. This can be overwhelming. So here‚Äôs a list of<br>
important sources that you need.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Projector video</strong>. This is a <em>Video Capture Device</em>. Your webcam. Add a new <em>Video Capture Device</em><br>
and select your CamLink with the projector image. Make sure to set the framerate right with the tools<br>
by Elgato (see <a href="(/streaming-your-meetup-part-1-projector/)">the chapter on projector video</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Projector audio</strong>. You are using HDMI, that‚Äôs why you get audio input from your laptop as well.<br>
Adding a new <em>Audio Input Capture</em> adds your CamLinks audio signal to your mixer. This is great<br>
if your speaker uses audio in their talks or if they show videos. Audio sources are also added to your<br>
Mixer where you can selectively mute them. Watch the <em>Mic/Aux</em> part. This one should be muted in your<br>
break scenes, as it could contain some background sound from the microphone attached to it.<br>
Level your audio so it‚Äôs comfortably in the yellow area of the loundness scale.</li>
<li><strong>Speaker video</strong>. Another <em>Video Capture</em> Device with your second camera. Either via CamLink or<br>
via USB.</li>
<li><strong>Speaker audio</strong>. Another <em>Audio Input Capture</em> with your speaker‚Äôs voice. Either from the standard<br>
<em>External Microphone</em> attached to your audio jack, or from your webcam, or from a Zoom. Whatever<br>
you‚Äôve chosen.</li>
<li><strong>Backdrop</strong>. I create a nice backdrop for our stream with the logo of the event, and maybe it‚Äôs<br>
number. In full HD. I use an <em>Image</em> source and add it to the mix.</li>
<li><strong>Background mnusic</strong>. A loop for the breaks. It‚Äôs a <em>Media source</em> where I select something catch<br>
from <a href="https://incompetech.com/">Kevin MacLeod</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Depending on how you want to style your stream, you also can have some text sources with the speaker<br>
names or similar.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/streaming-13.jpg" alt="Sources and audio"></p>
<p>Every source you create is added to the selected scene. You can move them around, change the size and<br>
crop it to your liking. This one is actually the tedious part and requires the most work.</p>
<p>Sources are however globally available. This means that you can create a new source at a different<br>
scene, or just use the one you already created.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs how I distribute sources along scenes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intro and Break</strong>: <em>Backdrop</em> and <em>Background music</em>. I mute <em>Mic/Aux</em>. I might add a <em>Text Source</em><br>
with a quick statement that we are either ‚Äústarting soon‚Äù or ‚Äúhaving a break‚Äù.</li>
<li><strong>Scene</strong>: I add the <em>Backdrop</em>, <em>Projector Audio</em>, <em>Projector Video</em>, <em>Speaker Audio</em> and <em>Speaker Video</em><br>
nicely arranged. I might add another <em>Text Source</em> showing speaker name and talk title.</li>
<li><strong>Cam only</strong>: Includes <em>Speaker Video</em>, <em>Speaker Audio</em>, <em>Projector Audio</em>. Nothing more.</li>
<li><strong>Projector only</strong>: Includes <em>Speaker Audio</em>, <em>Projector Video</em>, <em>Projector Audio</em>. Nothing more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Scenes may vary a bit depending on the meetup. But in general this is my setup. Now get it out the public!</p>
<h2>Streaming and Recording</h2>
<p>Let‚Äôs assume you want to stream it via YouTube. Usually you go to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live_dashboard">live stream dashboard</a> to get started. Make sure you try this out way before your first meetup. It can take up to 24hours for<br>
YouTube to verify you. Once you are ready and you set up your live stream, look at the live stream page for the<br>
<strong>Encoder setup</strong>. This part shows a streaming server and a key. Copy both to a note or scribble it down. We need it.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/streaming-15.png" alt="Streaming encoder setup"></p>
<p>We need this data to set up our streaming environment. In general, OBS needs a streaming server and some form<br>
of authentication, no matter which service you use.</p>
<p>Go to <em>Settings</em> ‚Üí <em>Stream</em> and select your streaming service of choice. Enter your streaming key (in case<br>
of YouTube) and you are set.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/streaming-14.jpg" alt="Streaming setup"></p>
<p>You have two buttons in your main UI: <em>Start Streaming</em> and <em>Start Recording</em>. Press <em>Start Streaming</em> to<br>
get everything out to YouTube. Everytime a talk starts, I also press <em>Start Recording</em>. I stop it after the talk<br>
ends. This gives me a nice MKV file I can edit later to have a ‚Äúclean‚Äù version for our YouTube channel.</p>
<p>Don‚Äôt record everything in one sitting. Your memory might get filled up and you can‚Äôt end recording.</p>
<p>A click on a scene activates the scene. Which means when you stream, this is the scene you are currently streaming.</p>
<p>Congratulations! You are a streamer!</p>
<h2>Studio Mode</h2>
<p>One last tip is <em>Studio Mode</em>. When you activate it, you see two scenes. The scene that is<br>
streaming on the right, and any upcoming scene you wish on the left. This gives you some time<br>
to prepare the screen (e.g. changing the speaker name or similar), and makes sure you don‚Äôt accidentally<br>
click on a scene you don‚Äôt want to stream. This is however very heavy on your machine, so make good use<br>
when you know you can afford it.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/streaming-16.jpg" alt="Studio mode"></p>
<h2>The end.</h2>
<p>This is it! So far, at least. We were able to get a decent streaming setup for <strong>315 EUR</strong>,<br>
and with the professional, yet free <strong>Open Broadcaster Software</strong> we are able to stream<br>
the whole show over the wire to your meetup members who can‚Äôt attend.</p>
<p>We‚Äôve done this a lot with meetups like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCm-I-sGS8ZivBDHB9erkjCg">Technologieplauscherl</a><br>
(where we even have a streamer collective) and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPOgnyDt0w76ZcjOgtKpjgA">Stahlstadt.js</a>.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm really curious if you used this guide and how it helped you.<br>
Please reach out to me on <a href="https://twitter.com/ddprrt">Twitter</a> and chat with me. I really<br>
want to know which setup you have decided on.</p>
<p>And never forget to practice. I‚Äôve recorded a couple of meetups now and everytime I find<br>
things that I thought I can do better next time. Having a trial run never is a bad idea.</p>
<p>And with that! Have fun and stream on a budget!</p>
