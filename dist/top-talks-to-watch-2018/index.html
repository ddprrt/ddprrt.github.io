    <p>It‚Äôs that time of the year again! For the fourth time in a row, I‚Äôm sharing my most<br>
favourite conference talks of the year! And again I found some incredible gems that I can‚Äôt<br>
wait to share with you!</p>
<p>Before we start, let‚Äôs have a quick recap on the previous years:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/top-talks-to-watch-2015/">My most favourite talks in 2015</a></li>
<li><a href="/top-talks-to-watch-2016/">My most favourite talks in 2016 ‚Äì the conference videos strike back!</a></li>
<li><a href="/top-talks-to-watch-2017/">My most favourite talks in 2017 ‚Äì Return of the Bingewatch</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Now it‚Äôs the fourth part of this series, which means I have to de-construct everything I had<br>
done before and let in some new things. Let‚Äôs call it <em>My most favourite talks of 2018 -<br>
the Audience awakens</em>. Let‚Äôs go!</p>
<h2>Isabella Silveira De Souza - Empathy Driven Development</h2>
<p><em>Empathy Driven Development</em> by <a href="https://twitter.com/silveira_bells">Isabella</a> is not your everyday performance talk.<br>
Instead of jumping right into performance optimization land, Isa takes her time to<br>
showcase life in Brazil. Life that can be totally different from what I as a Central<br>
European am used to. Sometimes the differences are big. Sometimes nuanced.</p>
<p>Isa centers around communication. And how people in Brazil use the web to stay connected,<br>
even if some boundaries might appear in real life. Fascinating!</p>
<p>From there Isa segues seamlessly into a tech heavy performance optimization talk. Solving real problems of real people. Chapeau! üëè</p>

<h2>Richard Feldman - Billion Dollar Foresight</h2>
<p>I know <a href="https://twitter.com/rtfeldman">Richard Feldman</a> as <em>the</em> Elm developer advocate. In his talks, he seems<br>
like he‚Äôs the happiest client side developer only because of all the functional<br>
programming extravaganza Elm brings to him. I never touched Elm, but I enjoyed<br>
his talks nonetheless.</p>
<p>This one is arguably one of his best. Instead of flat out going into the wonders<br>
of Elm, he reiterates on the ‚ÄúBillion Dollar Mistake‚Äù of introducing null<br>
references in programming languages. A concept that some languages want to get rid<br>
of. Languages like JavaScript, well, they have even two null reference concepts.</p>
<p>Richard shows the struggles of <code>null</code> in an incredibly entertaining way. Leading<br>
to the age-old question: What if there were no null references?</p>
<p>I immediately bought <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/elm-in-action">his book ‚ÄúElm in Action‚Äù</a><br>
afterwards. Check it out, it‚Äôs a fun talk:</p>

<h2>Siren Hofvander - Making Security an integrated part of the SW Dev Lifecycle</h2>
<p>I had the pleasure to see <a href="https://twitter.com/securitypony">Siren</a>‚Äôs talk this year life at <a href="https://devone.at">DevOne</a>.<br>
Siren gave probably the best introduction to security in software one can think of.</p>
<p>Where the usual security talk is filled with creepy stories of big security holes and<br>
the devastating effects of not thinking everything through to the end, Siren takes a step<br>
back, tells everyone to relax, and shows a good way of taking on security one step at<br>
a time.</p>
<p>I found this talk incredibly inspiring and uplifting. Also wonderfully presented.<br>
Be sure to check it out.</p>

<h2>Sophie Albert, Dan Abramov, Ryan Florence - React Today and Tomorrow and 90% cleaner React</h2>
<p>Not a year without a framework talk, hm? You might know that I‚Äôm incredibly late<br>
to the React party. Nonetheless I have more fun using it than I ever thought I would have.</p>
<p>The fun comes from using functional components (in conjunction with <a href="/typescript-react/">TypeScript</a>). In this talk, Dan and Sophie show us the future of functional<br>
components by introducing the concept of hooks. A concept where I got the feeling for the<br>
first time in a while that this might be an absolute game changer.</p>
<p>Brilliant way of presenting, wonderful life demos. And once you thought: Can this be real,<br>
Ryan Florence comes on stage to show a real world example refactored with hooks. Just to<br>
make you even more excited.</p>
<p>90 minutes of footage worth to check out!</p>

<h2>Kelsey Hightower - Kubernetes and the Path to Serverless</h2>
<p>I‚Äôm pretty new to the whole Kubernetes thing and most likely won‚Äôt touch it too much<br>
in my career. Nonetheless, I enjoyed <a href="https://twitter.com/kelseyhightower">Kelsey Hightower‚Äôs</a> take on Kubernetes with Serverless.</p>
<p>I won‚Äôt spoil too much, but Kelsey‚Äôs way of presenting is so engaging, fun, inspiring and<br>
motivational. He gets an audience applauding the black heroines of 60s NASA, segueing into<br>
modern day cloud computing. Then going into a light and fun talk about FORTRAN in the cloud.</p>
<p>All genuine and to the point. What a captivating stage presence. üëè</p>

<h2>David DeSandro - Read color hex codes</h2>
<p>I‚Äôve seen <a href="https://twitter.com/desandro">David</a> speak at Front Trends in Warsaw way back in 2013. For whatever reason,<br>
I have never seen a talk from him since then until this one he gave at<br>
<a href="https://dotcss.io">DotCSS</a> in December.</p>
<p>And what a talk it was! David is colour blind. And a designer. He chooses his colours<br>
by looking at their hex code. That‚Äôs how he‚Äôs able to understand how hue, lightness<br>
and saturation play together.</p>
<p>Look at this talk. I‚Äôve been working with colour spaces for the last 20 years, I would<br>
have never thought about this human friendly way of interpreting hex codes.</p>
<p>Highly recommended. Most likely my most favourite talk of the year.</p>

<h2>Shameless plug: Automating UI development</h2>
<p>A shameless plug: My most favourite speaking experience in 2018. Talking together with<br>
Katrin about some work we‚Äôve been cooking for the last months at Europe‚Äôs biggest<br>
Angular conference.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve spoken at lengths about our talk <a href="/angular-connect/">in another place</a>. Allow me to<br>
end this list with a quick link to the video.</p>
