    <p>When we did <a href="https://scriptconf.org/2018">Script‚Äô18</a> in January 2018, we borrowed an A/V equipment worth of 35.000 EUR<br>
to make sure we get kick-ass videos. A+ camera, an A/V mixer and a hard disc recording system that does<br>
editing on the fly. We wanted to go live with our recordings directly after the conference.</p>
<p>It turned out that some mysterious error never stored any video data, just audio. We were devastated.</p>
<p>Last summer I decided to take matter in our own hands. Understand which pieces we need to be able to edit, record and<br>
stream videos from all our conferences, meetups and all other events we might do. And I wanted to go from pro equipment<br>
to consumer class equipment. See how much quality we can get out of off the shelf pieces.</p>
<p>I want to share my findings with you. Maybe you get some ideas for your own meetup or conference. I go from super cheap<br>
to quite expensive in some cases. But I always refrain from pro equipment.</p>
<p>I split the whole series into four pieces:</p>
<ol>
<li>Basics and Projector ‚Äì üìç<em>you are here</em></li>
<li><a href="/streaming-your-meetup-part-2-video/">Recording the speaker</a></li>
<li><a href="/streaming-your-meetup-part-3-audio/">Recording audio</a></li>
<li><a href="/streaming-your-meetup-part-4-obs/">Directing and streaming with OBS</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
<h2>Basics</h2>
<p>Before you start any stream with the possible combinations of hardware equipment, you need some basics.</p>
<h3>A powerful laptop, a powerful graphics card</h3>
<p>I underestimated the need for a powerful laptop to be able to record with at least 30 frames per second. Slides<br>
usually go for 30 frames per talk, but if you want to have a video recording of your speaker that‚Äôs smooth and<br>
without any significant frame drops, make sure that you have a laptop with its own graphics card.</p>
<p>If you‚Äôre using a Mac, the 15&quot; Macbook Pros have a proper graphics card. 13&quot; Macbooks have onboard graphics.<br>
If your specs say something from <em>NVIDIA</em> to <em>ATI</em> you can be pretty sure.</p>
<p>Alternatives: Get an external graphics card (they exist) like the <a href="https://amzn.to/2SxFszU">Razor Core X (Amazon)</a> - around 300-500 EUR.</p>
<h3>HDMI cables, a couple of them</h3>
<p>You need a couple of HDMI cables to record your stuff. Make sure you have a couple of them in different lengths<br>
to be prepared for your surroundings. It‚Äôs easier with a meetup as the room is usually much smaller and the<br>
layout is more casual. This means you can be directly in the first row and don‚Äôt need long HDMI cables.</p>
<p>For a conference, you sometimes need to layout 20m worth of HDMI cables. This is where HDMI has its limits. Starting<br>
from 7m, you get one-directional cables. Which means you need to make sure you have to take care where the ends are.</p>
<p>I usually have 2-3 HDMI cables around 1.5m, one cable around 3m, and a longer one that spans 10m.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/2SG4ahC">1.8m bi-directonal (Amazon)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/2Gur2f8">3m bi-directional (Amazon)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/2SBbevQ">7.5m bi-directonal (Amazon)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/2JVRAqs">10.5m one direction (Amazon)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You‚Äôll spend around 50 EUR.</p>
<h3>A network cable</h3>
<p>If you want to stream, I recommend using good old ethernet connections rather than WiFi. WiFi, even strong ones that have<br>
good upstream, have interferences, cause stalls, and don‚Äôt produce the same quality as going over the wire.</p>
<p>Ask your meetup host if they have a LAN connection. They also should open all ports to make sure the streaming servers<br>
are reachable.</p>
<p>I have a recent Macbook Pro, so I only have USB-C jacks. I bought a cheap adapter (that‚Äôs what Macbook users do) to<br>
have ethernet available:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/2JWLRRc">USB-C to Gigabit Ethernet adapter (Amazon)</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Recording the projector</h2>
<p>Our goal is to have a split screen view, like we know from conference videos, with this layout:</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/streaming-1.jpg" alt="A screen showing the projector and the speaker"></p>
<p>It contains</p>
<ul>
<li>Speaker audio</li>
<li>Speaker video</li>
<li>Projector video</li>
<li>Projector audio</li>
</ul>
<p>Let‚Äôs focus on the projector. We want to record the video output of our speaker‚Äôs laptop. We need this signal<br>
as an input for our laptop. Sounds hard! We can achieve this in two steps:</p>
<h3>1. Splitting the signal</h3>
<p>We somehow need to make sure the speaker laptop video out not only goes to the projector, but also to us.<br>
For that we need to split the signal and lead it to both video input sinks.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/streaming-2.svg?id=2" alt="Diagram showing what we want to do"></p>
<p>For that, I can highly recommend the CSL HDMI Splitter. Works like a charm, has external power supply to<br>
make sure that it can handle the signal. One input, two outputs, 20 EUR:</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/streaming-3.jpg" alt="HDMI Splitter"></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/2MaWIJY">4K HDMI Splitter (Amazon)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I usually take one of my 1.8m cables to connect the speaker laptop to the splitter in, take the projector cable<br>
to output 1, and use one of my 7.5m or 3m cables to connect it from output 2 to my laptop.</p>
<p>But wait! We can‚Äôt simply plug this one into our HDMI jack. Laptop‚Äôs HDMI plugs only produce a video out signal,<br>
no video in. For that we need another tool: A video grabbing device.</p>
<h3>2. Grabbing the video signal</h3>
<p>We need a special plug that transforms the video in signal into something our laptops can understand. We need<br>
to convert the signal into a ‚Ä¶ webcam! There‚Äôs a tool for that. Coming from the game streaming community called<br>
CamLink. It takes HDMI for input and has an USB connector so you can plug it into your laptop.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/streaming-4.jpg" alt="CamLink 4K"></p>
<p>It‚Äôs pretty much plug and play. You can immediately use it as a webcam.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/2K3NiNX">CamLink 4K (Amazon)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I recommend installing their <a href="https://www.elgato.com/de/gaming/downloads">Game Capture</a> software. It‚Äôs not what<br>
we need to stream our meetup, but you are able to do some settings for the CamLink. Like recuding framerate, or<br>
resolution. It might help with some notebooks to get a signal without interferences.</p>
<p>Plug it in and try it out with your favourite Webcam software.</p>
<h2>Money spent so far</h2>
<p>We want to keep it as affordable as it can be. Right now we spent:</p>
<ul>
<li>50 EUR on HDMI cables</li>
<li>20 EUR for <a href="https://amzn.to/2MaWIJY">4K HDMI Splitter (Amazon)</a></li>
<li>120 EUR for <a href="https://amzn.to/2K3NiNX">CamLink 4K (Amazon)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>A total of 190 EUR to get started.</p>
<h2>Cheap alternative if you don‚Äôt want to stream, just record</h2>
<p>This setup is convenient if you want to record and stream without any hassle. And without being constraint on the input<br>
signal: if it can produce HDMI, you can record it.</p>
<p>If you don‚Äôt want to stream, just record, and maybe have some time to assemble videos in post production, you can always<br>
ask one thing: Speakers shall record their own screen. On Mac this is possible via QuickTime. And I just found out<br>
Windows 10 has a <a href="https://www.techradar.com/how-to/record-your-screen">built-in screen recorder</a> as well.</p>
<p>Costs: 0. You have to do serious post production, though.</p>
<p>Coming up next: Recording the speaker!</p>
