&lt;p&gt;React’s context API has be slumbering inside for a while. With one of the latest releases, they decide to open&lt;br&gt;
this API to everybody. It’s very nice to use if you like render props. If not, there’s always the new hooks&lt;br&gt;
API that makes it even easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TypeScript works amazingly well with context. You don’t need to provide any type definitions at all. Only in some&lt;br&gt;
edge cases.&lt;/p&gt;
