    <p>You might well see that my blog starts to center around TypeScript a lot recently. This might look<br>
like a strong deviation from what I usually blog and advocate: Performant, accessible and resilient<br>
web sites.</p>
<p>A lot of people ask me why I do so much with TypeScript, and why I see it as such a central piece of<br>
my day to day work. Let me explain by looking at the three encounters I had with TypeScript.</p>
<h2>1. November 2012 - TypeScript at our local meetup</h2>
<p>Just a month after TypeScript got released, some people showed their features at one of our local<br>
meetups. <a href="https://fettblog.eu/blog/2012/11/26/technologieplauscherl-at-netural/">I even blogged about it</a>. I<br>
could see benefits back then, but was sceptical. Especially when I saw friends of mine using it. They usually<br>
came from the back-end side of things. Mostly Java and C#. That’s why they strongly relied on things like<br>
“abstract classes” and “interface hierachies” and “factories” and “static classes” and … <strong>yuck</strong>! All this<br>
POOOP (patterns of object oriented programming) and SHIT (somehow hierachical interface trees) in my<br>
JavaScript?</p>
<p>That’s not JavaScript. And I like JavaScript!</p>
<p>So I dismissed TypeScript.</p>
<h2>2. Around 2015 - Giving Angular a try</h2>
<p>Staying curious, I tried out the upcoming version of Angular. Don’t pin me on the date. It was a<br>
release candidate of Angular 2. A framework that pushed TypeScript to more popularity. And the first steps<br>
I made needed to be very strongly typed. So much annotations and decorators Angular needs to understand your<br>
code. <code>any</code> was my best friend. But I got lost, and I gave up. I remember me saying: “TypeScript wants to know<br>
the type of my backend results. How do I know? I haven’t even console logged it, yet!”</p>
<p>And… that wasn’t JavaScript. And I like JavaScript!</p>
<p>So… I decided to stay off of TypeScript for a while. To be fair, back then my Angular knowledge was very<br>
limited. And I think so was my willigness to change that.</p>
<h2>3. Paternity leave 2018. Learning</h2>
<p>I was on paternity leave in 2018 for three months, and had the chance to learn a lot while my baby child<br>
was sleeping. I also learned new programming languages. And I thought I should give TypeScript and React a<br>
try. Just to better know what I’m talking about. And being able to judge without looking at mere aesthetics.</p>
<p>When working with TypeScript, I found out that I can just write JavaScript like I’m used to. No complaining<br>
from a compiler. No extra annotations. No fuss.</p>
<p>But then came the revelation: TypeScript analyses my code constantly. And can give great information on my<br>
code without me needing to do anything. Information my editor shows to me every time I write.</p>
<p>The truth is, if you are using VSCode and write JavaScript, you most likely are using TypeScript without your<br>
knowledge. The TypeScript language server runs in the background, analyses your code and gives you as much<br>
information as it can. This allows you to get a better development experience without the need to do anything.</p>
<p>TypeScript becomes an extra brain that knows my code much better than I do. And where it doesn’t, I can give<br>
TypeScript a little bit of extra type information to make it understand. And since you can do<br>
so much with JavaScript, TypeScript strives for being as complete as possible to type all the constructs<br>
your JavaScript code can have.</p>
<p>This goes well with TypeScript’s design goals</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s gradual. Which means you can adopt TypeScript features whenever you feel the need to.</li>
<li>Extensive type inference. TypeScript wants to know your JavaScript</li>
<li>Control flow analysis. Everytime TypeScript can help you narrowing down possible types, it does.</li>
<li>It closely tracks the ECMAScript standard. Nowadays you don’t get extra language features that haven’t<br>
reached stage 3 in ECMAScript</li>
<li>Innovations happen in the type system. TypeScript wants to give better ways to express your JavaScript</li>
<li>Tooling, tooling, tooling. TypeScript’s not here to restrict you. TypeScript is here to provide you with<br>
tools that make you more productive.</li>
</ul>
<p>I also watched a ton of YouTube back then, checked out old JSConf videos of historical introductions.<br>
That’s how I stumpled upon the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UTIcQYQ8Rw">introduction of TypeScript</a> at<br>
<a href="http://JSConf.EU">JSConf.EU</a> 2012. The way Anders describes the design goals of TypeScript hasn’t changed that much. Being a<br>
type layer on top of JavaScript has been TypeScript’s goal since the very beginning. Language features were<br>
a side effect. A side effect based on lots of tries from previous standardisation efforts like ES4.</p>
<p>So TypeScript… is JavaScript. JavaScript with benefits. And I like Javascript! And I like benefits.</p>
<p>My approach:</p>
<ol>
<li>Write JavaScript. Be happy when something isn’t <code>any</code></li>
<li>Every time you want to have better types, add type annotations</li>
<li>Enjoy this as some extra documentation when you revisit a project</li>
<li>Stay away from any extra language stuff that mixes type annotations with stage 3 JavaScript. They are a<br>
relict of old times.</li>
</ol>
<p>And when you work like that, it’s easy to like TypeScript. And that’s why I use it so much and why I want to<br>
write about it. It helps me, my co-workers, and my future self to actually know what I’ve been thinking. Can’t<br>
go wrong without that.</p>
<p>Btw. If you want the benefits, but stay away from the compile step, check out how to write<br>
<a href="/typescript-jsdoc-superpowers/">TypeScript without TypeScript</a>. This is actually useful. Libraries like<br>
<a href="https://github.com/preactjs/preact">Preact</a> manage to give you full TypeScript support and tooling, but<br>
still stay in JavaScript land for contributions and coding.</p>
