    <p>I rarely talk about attending or speaking at conferences, but sometimes you just<br>
have to point out some extraordinary events.</p>
<p>Just two weeks ago I had the opportunity to join some folks at<br>
<a href="http://www.portotechhub.com">Porto Tech Hub</a>, a one-day, two-track conference<br>
happening in Portugal. Like many conferences, the Tech Hub had speakers from<br>
various fields talking about new and upcoming trends in software development.<br>
With me being the odd bird standing out, talking about CSS and engineering in front<br>
of a .NET heavy audience. Judging from the feedback however, they enjoyed my little<br>
excursion into custom property territories.</p>
<p>Porto is a city with a booming tech scene. Lots of great start-ups and IT companies<br>
working super successful in the international market. It reminded me a lot of my<br>
home town of Linz in that regard. It might not be the capital of the country, but<br>
has the most interesting software companies and the best jobs for developers and<br>
designers.</p>
<p>But the companies from Porto managed one thing that rarely any other city is capable of:<br>
Some of their biggest players (Farfetch, Blip and Critical) joined efforts to form<br>
a non-profit organisation in Porto to strengthen the city’s efforts of growing even<br>
more. Together they want to ensure that Porto is an attractive place to work in, and<br>
also to encourage new companies to select Porto as their main location for their new<br>
offices. Instead of competing over the next employee, they create an environment where<br>
everyone has benefits from. This is outstanding!</p>
<p>The conference I was speaking at is the prime example of their efforts. The atmosphere<br>
at the event was relaxed. People from different organisations and companies got together,<br>
enjoyed the talks and had lots of fun in-between sessions. Some of them – even though<br>
they never met before – even went out to dinner together after the beer party.</p>
<p>For me, this was exceptional. I’ve attended lots of conferences before. At some<br>
of them I didn’t meet a single new face amongst 3500 attendees, and at some others<br>
I was immediately welcomed into the inner circle of a huge community. Porto Tech Hub<br>
sure falls into the latter category.</p>
<p>And I’m sure this has a lot to do with the exceptional organisation done by Diana<br>
and her team. There’s the saying that “Quality is the time spent on detail”, and<br>
you could find this love for detail in every single piece of the conference.<br>
Venue, speakers, sponsors, rooms, party, even down to finding the perfect coffee.</p>
<p>With Sebastian and me now creating <a href="https://scriptconf.org">Script’17</a>, a one-day<br>
JavaScript event with some – dare I say – amazing line-up, there’s sure a lot<br>
to learn from the great efforts the organisers of Porto Tech Hub have put into their<br>
event.</p>
<p>Thank you for having me, Porto, and thank you Diana, Luis, Ines and all the others<br>
for creating such a great environment and such a loving and welcoming atmosphere.<br>
Thank you for letting us feel the true Portuguese hospitality!</p>
