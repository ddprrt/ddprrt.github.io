    <p>We just started the <em>Call for Presentations</em> for the upcoming <a href="https://devone.at">DevOne</a> conference,<br>
and I couldn’t be more excited. Last year’s proposals where excellent and a great addition to our<br>
line-up. And by looking at the people who already registered interest, I’m sure that there’s a ton of<br>
great stuff coming up.</p>
<p>I’m in the program committee for this conference and <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScCPxV1j0obnHyneKXrEmOVaOxZOkIqgeOTan9pNfIAJTQ5tw/viewform?usp=send_form">I’d love to hear your ideas</a>. If you’re not<br>
sure, please get in touch with me. I’ll happily guide you through what we’re looking for DevOne.</p>

<p>DevOne features 12 talks in two parallel tracks. Two of the slots are reserved for our CfP speakers. This also means that there’s<br>
usually a high amount of people not being selected. Having been on both sides of the spectrum, as a speaker applying to conferences<br>
and as a committee member, I thought I put together some tips for your proposal to hit it!</p>
<h2>Know the conference</h2>
<p>I’ve applied to so many conferences, and I also failed at so many more. In hindsight, for most of the conferences I failed, I never<br>
was the right speaker to begin with. I applied because I loved the conference and its community, not because my talk was a good fit.</p>
<p>It got a lot easier when I selected conferences where I knew that the topic was hitting the nail on the head. I got more acquainted<br>
with what the conference was actually looking for.</p>
<p>Go and look at past line-ups. Check out the videos, their community, and their usual selection of talks.</p>

<p>A Kubernetes talk might not be the right thing for the CSS community. A new JavaScript framework might not be fitting out when the<br>
major topics are CI/CD.</p>
<p>This does not mean that their isn’t the odd bird standing out that will fit perfect to the rest of the line-up. But tailoring it to<br>
what conferences are usually looking for is never a bad idea.</p>
<p>Conferences are usually pretty clear about that. The <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScCPxV1j0obnHyneKXrEmOVaOxZOkIqgeOTan9pNfIAJTQ5tw/viewform?usp=send_form">DevOne CfP</a> gives you a<br>
list of topics right from the start. Check if your topic feels comfortable with that list.</p>
<h2>Share what you got</h2>
<p>Many conferences, just like DevOne, have a special field in their CfP where you can put any extra information in for the<br>
organisers. This is not something for the public, but rather for the PC to know what they’re dealing with.</p>
<p>Use this field.</p>

  <figcaption>Simon's talk about their Ruby architecture was the odd bird standing out. But the details he provided
  where pretty convincing.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Put in everything you got. Talk outlines, extra information, research results. Every quirk or extra that makes your delivery or<br>
talk special. The clearer the picture is for organisers, the better.</p>
<h2>Ask for feedback</h2>
<p>If you are unsure about your proposal, ask for feedback. Ask your colleagues, ask your peers, ask the organisers. Usually they<br>
are very happy to provide feedback. It’s in their own interest to craft a great program, so why wouldn’t they give you feedback.</p>

  <figcaption>Katja was the first person to apply for last year's DevOne. And the first person to be selected.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>One thing that I started doing was to ask for feedback once a talk wasn’t selected. Organisers usually give great advice on what went<br>
wrong. From having a topic that was extensively covered already to a “not in tune with what’s happening in the community”. Especially<br>
the last advice was really helpful for me.</p>
<p>Feedback helps you shaping up your proposal. If not for this conference, maybe for the next.</p>
<h2>Final note</h2>
<p>But in the end: Don’t worry. Even with your best proposal ever, there’s still a lot of chance involved. Some conferences get way<br>
over 500 proposals, and only feature a handful of free slots.</p>
<p>It’s like with everything else: Try. Do your best. If you fail, try again.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
