&lt;p&gt;Okay, lovely people, this is huge for me. I’m actually in the midst of writing a&lt;br&gt;
book. It’s called “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.manning.com/books/front-end-tooling-with-gulp-bower-and-yeoman/?a_aid=fettblog&amp;amp;a_bid=238ac06a&quot;&gt;Front-End Tooling with Gulp, Bower and Yeoman&lt;/a&gt;”, and it’s&lt;br&gt;
– you guessed it – about front-end tooling with Gulp, Bower and Yeoman. Actually&lt;br&gt;
I’ve been writing on it for the last 9 months, and now it has reached the phase of&lt;br&gt;
going public for the first time. It’s in the so called “Early Access Program” from&lt;br&gt;
Manning (MEAP), where you can buy it before it goes to print, helping me pointing at&lt;br&gt;
all the mistakes I make. Or do some slap on the back because it’s so good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a huge step for me, but a small MEAP for mankind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;That marketing lady&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tend to call my book “FETT”, because it’s the name of the blog. It that case, it stands&lt;br&gt;
for “Front-End Tooling Talk”. I’ve written and talked a lot about&lt;br&gt;
different tools for Front-End developers in the last few years, so some guys thought it might be a good&lt;br&gt;
idea to turn those thoughts into a book. So here are the learnings that I made&lt;br&gt;
at my time at Netural and my current employment at &lt;a href=&quot;http://ruxit.com&quot;&gt;Ruxit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why those three tools?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gulp&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, here’s the thing: I won’t do that stereotypical things with you every Gulp&lt;br&gt;
course tries to do. The ever-repetitive “If you want to build this, use that&lt;br&gt;
plugin. And if you want to use that, use this plugin” mantra you see over and&lt;br&gt;
over again. So many people have shown you how there Gulpfile looks like and that’s&lt;br&gt;
absolutely fine. Because you can learn a lot from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you wouldn’t need a book telling you the same. This is where the Gulp part&lt;br&gt;
from “FETT” differs: You will learn how Gulp and streams work underneath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will learn that Gulp is basically a collection of other tools combined&lt;br&gt;
under one graspable API. That it uses streams and virtual file systems.&lt;br&gt;
And you will learn not only how super awesome this is to use, but also where&lt;br&gt;
the catch is when you want to combine it with other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will spend a good deal of time showing you the wonderful art&lt;br&gt;
of pipeline crafting. You can do so much with stream arrays, incremental builds,&lt;br&gt;
pipe snippets, merged streams, etc. that really helps your special use cases.&lt;br&gt;
You will also learn when to extend Gulp and when to just let it be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for which&lt;br&gt;
plugin will compile Sass for you or PostCSS or React or whatever, you will figure&lt;br&gt;
that out on your own. Here you will learn &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; a &lt;code&gt;gulp-ruby-sass&lt;/code&gt; behaves a tad&lt;br&gt;
different from &lt;code&gt;gulp-sass&lt;/code&gt;, and how you can combine it with un-Sass-y things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
![Ancient swordsman says: Do a build pipeline](/wp-content/uploads/2015/fett-meap.jpg)
&lt;/div&gt;
So that&#39;s pretty advanced stuff for Gulp, but it always burns down to a common denominator
all build tools have: Getting your stuff processed to have some great result in
the end. Heck, we even used Grunt at some point, but then decided that Gulp would
be a more fitting technology because of its flexibility. And to be honest: It&#39;s
a lot more fun.
&lt;h2&gt;Bower&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same thing is going on with Bower. It’s pretty boring to learn how to install&lt;br&gt;
stuff. It’s more fun knowing what dependency trees are and what you have to keep&lt;br&gt;
an eye on when creating new components. Those learnings are directly transferrable&lt;br&gt;
to every other package manager out there. Want to use NPM instead of Bower? Same&lt;br&gt;
chapters work for you, because your knowledge will be universal (JavaScript, buzzword-bombing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Yeoman&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last one. This tool is actually the thing that got me here in the first place,&lt;br&gt;
as it brings the whole workflow of building pipelines, dependency managers and&lt;br&gt;
project templates to a full circle. &lt;a href=&quot;http://fettblog.eu/introduction-to-yeoman-slides/&quot;&gt;Yeoman&lt;/a&gt; helped our Front-End team keeping project&lt;br&gt;
standards fresh and exciting for all our 10 developers. And again, since installing&lt;br&gt;
and using generators is pretty boring to teach, you will learn how to create your own generator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A modern workflow for the modern developer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So hey, join me and a lot of other developers on a wonderful journey.&lt;br&gt;
