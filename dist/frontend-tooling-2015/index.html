&lt;p&gt;I happen to hold my third iteration of the “Frontend Tooling with Grunt and Yeoman” workshop at this years  &lt;a href=&quot;http://javascript-days.de/2015/&quot;&gt;JavaScript Days&lt;/a&gt; in March. It’s in Munich, so if you happen to be bear this lovely town, drop by and learn a lot about different JavaScript technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, they also have track soley dedicated to &lt;a href=&quot;http://angularjs-days.de&quot;&gt;Angular JS&lt;/a&gt;, held by my friends over at &lt;a href=&quot;http://symetics.de&quot;&gt;Symetics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, a bunch of friends are there, including Jens Grochtdreis and Peter Kröner. I really look forward to see them again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re curious what’s in with my half-day workshop, feel free to take a look at the slides from the last year’s iteration. I constantly keep updating the contents to the current eco-system (also including some Gulp), plus giving a good look at the things to come:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you happen to stay a tad longer in Munich, we might see each other at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.braukunst-live.com/home/&quot;&gt;beer festival&lt;/a&gt; the day after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want the workshop for the guys at your office and in private, don’t hesitate to &lt;a href=&quot;stefan@caped.at&quot;&gt;e-Mail me&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
