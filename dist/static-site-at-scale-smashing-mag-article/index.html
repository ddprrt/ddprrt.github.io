&lt;p&gt;I’m so incredibly happy to have my first article published on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/08/using-a-static-site-generator-at-scale-lessons-learned/&quot;&gt;Smashing Magazine&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a&lt;br&gt;
6000 word long story about how we managed to bring roughly 2000 pages on a technology stack made for hackers. It took me&lt;br&gt;
roughly four years to find a story that I’m eager enough to pursue, but in the end I think it totally paid off.&lt;br&gt;
Working with Smashing Magazine, especially Vitaly and Iris, was a complete joy! Thank you again for the professional and&lt;br&gt;
friendly work experience!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So everyone, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/08/using-a-static-site-generator-at-scale-lessons-learned/&quot;&gt;enjoy the read&lt;/a&gt; and let me know what you think!&lt;/p&gt;
