&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago I did a short talk on &lt;a href=&quot;http://yeoman.io&quot;&gt;Yeoman&lt;/a&gt; at the Linzer edition of &lt;a href=&quot;http://codeweek.eu&quot;&gt;Codeweek&lt;/a&gt; and how it helps us in our daily workflow. For the first time I tried to have some sort of script, and afterwards I even made notes. So aside from funny images, you even can read what I was talking about. Have fun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;I don’t know if you’ve ever heard from Yeoman or the Yeoman tools.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It might actually be that you’ve heard from the Yeoman warders who guard the tower of London. They’re also called beefeaters and might happen to have a strong taste for gin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They even have their own brand, which tastes great btw.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anyhow, the Yeoman warders at the Tower of London are helpful guides and show you around on your sightseeing tour. This helpfulness inspired a bunch of software developers like Addy Osmani to create a not less helpful tool or toolchain to guide you in your software development process. And Yeoman, or not be precise, Yo, is the result.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We’re using Yo to overcome a lot of obstacles in our day-to-day workflow. This is Pinky, my colleague and the guy I work with most of the time. The other one is a random “Brain” from our team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We happen to do a lot of new projects, mostly microsites, and have the need to kick-start a new project often on a weekly base. So, if we try to get a new project running, every developer has his own way of doing so.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While Pinky might call his folders like the technology he is using,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our random brain might call it after the actual type: Styles, scripts and templates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have one generic build running, like Grunt, you can adapt this very Gruntfile for each solution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This was even worse when we used a 1500 lines of code Ant File&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;which looked like this (Animation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And this was my face when my co-workers asked me to change the build to their new setup. Every single time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is where our Yeomen come in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First it give’s me the much needed Gin,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;but actually they’re helping me to settle on a good set of defaults and best practices, and provide a way to distribute them to everybody in my team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They’re doing this by so-called generators. Each generator is used for a different eco-system. You even can develop a generator to create a custom project setup for your very own team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It also helps to overcome the blank page angst. You don’t have to start from scratch and actually have a good setup where you can easily add your new parts. This helped me a lot when starting with Angular, because there were a lot of repetitive patterns which I couldn’t memorise at first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yo is based on node.js, so it is easily installed with NPM. The second command installs a generator. This is one provided by the Yeoman community, which is strongly supported by Google. That’s one reason why they have a nifty Angular generator ready. To kickstart a new Angular project, just run &lt;code&gt;yo angular&lt;/code&gt; in your project folder. Yo will find yourself in a short questionnaire to set some options and parameters, after that Yeoman takes care of the rest. They’re also some subgenerators possible. In this case, I can add a new directive to an existing Angular project. Let’s try this out (demo)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you’re not happy with the community generator, it’s easy to create your own. Yo has even a generator for generators, which gives you the very basic setup. After that, you just have four commands which you really need to finish your generator.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;this.prompt()&lt;/code&gt; sets up the questionnaire and sets some variables. With &lt;code&gt;this.dest.mkdir()&lt;/code&gt; you’re creating new directories, &lt;code&gt;this.src.copy()&lt;/code&gt; copies files from your generators template directory to the desired destination, and &lt;code&gt;this.src.template()&lt;/code&gt; does the same, but allows form parametrised output using underscore templates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the moment there are about 1100 generators available&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even our own one which is open source. Feel free to learn from it, we sure did a lot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With this generator we managed to setup one project structure easily every time we need it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have a lot more time for Gin now&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And also a much happier face. Thank you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
