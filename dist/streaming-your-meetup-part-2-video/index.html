    <p>We successfully set up the projector in our last <a href="/streaming-your-meetup-part-1-projector/">chapter</a>.<br>
Now it‚Äôs time to record the speaker himself. I‚Äôll show you a couple of options how you can record<br>
the speaker video. It‚Äôs up to your budget and up to the quality you want to achieve.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/streaming-5.jpg" alt="Recording with a camera"></p>
<p>Maybe you are already into photography and have nice DSLR at home. This might totally do for recording<br>
the speaker video. Even better: This might acutally be the best option.</p>
<p>So check out how to record and stream your speaker, and be sure to check out the other parts as well:</p>

<li>Recording the speaker ‚Äì üìç<em>you are here</em></li>
<li><a href="/streaming-your-meetup-part-3-audio/">Recording audio</a></li>
<li><a href="/streaming-your-meetup-part-4-obs/">Directing and streaming with OBS</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Let‚Äôs go!</p>
<h2>A few words before we start</h2>
<p>The different options I show you are category based. I don‚Äôt have a favourite model or a favourite vendor.<br>
I just select based on certain criteria. Since we want to use consumer hardware, be happy with what you have<br>
lying around or your relatives can offer. Other than that, I always go for something affordable.</p>
<p>There‚Äôs two things to keep in mind:</p>
<ol>
<li>Camera audio always sucks. We don‚Äôt want to record camera audio, that‚Äôs why we check on audio in the next<br>
chapter. If you have to choose between two cameras that are similar in pricing, quality and features, always go<br>
for the camera that has an <strong>external</strong> microphone input. They exist, but are rare. It‚Äôs always better to connect<br>
your audio input directly with the cam, rather than mixing it on your laptop.</li>
<li>Not every camera has the possibility to be connected to your laptop. Most of them have HDMI out to be connected<br>
to a monitor or to your TV screen. There‚Äôs a solution for that, and you know it already from the last chapter:<br>
<a href="https://amzn.to/2K3NiNX">CamLink</a>. I bought a second one just for our cams. Also: never connect two CamLinks to<br>
the same USB port. Use two different ones, because they use all the power they need. Definitely check if your<br>
<a href="https://www.elgato.com/de/gaming/cam-link/camera-check">camera is compatible with CamLink</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>With every option you get, you‚Äôll also see info for those two criterias:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is an external microphone possible</li>
<li>Do you need CamLink</li>
</ol>
<p>Also, you most likely need a <a href="https://amzn.to/2OqUpoK">Tripod</a>. This one costs roughly 30 EUR.</p>
<p>Ready? Let‚Äôs check our first option.</p>
<h2>The webcam</h2>
<p>Who would have thought, a simple Webcam does the trick. Those things are not as popular anymore since<br>
every notebook has one built-in, but they still exist and are of great quality.</p>
<p>One that is very popular with streamers is the <a href="https://amzn.to/30PFwh6">Logitech C920</a>. Great video quality,<br>
plug and play, extra software to fine-tune it. My friend <a href="https://twitter.com/tompson">Tom</a> uses it to stream meetups, check out one<br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMfM7cV49Ts">of the recordings on YouTube</a>. Keep in mind that you have to be<br>
very close to the speaker to get a proper video.</p>
<p>The camera costs around 100 EUR, but sometimes it‚Äôs sold for around 70 EUR.</p>
<p>The best thing: IT FITS ON A TRIPOD! Yes! Probably the only webcam I know that can be mounted on a<br>
regular Tripod.</p>
<ul>
<li>No external microphone possible üëé</li>
<li>Does not need CamLink üëç</li>
</ul>
<h2>The camcorder</h2>
<p>For my meetups we use a camcorder. We bought the <a href="https://amzn.to/2GsPhu3">Legria HF R806</a>, but I‚Äôm not entirely<br>
convinced. It‚Äôs nice as it works with CamLink, but it doesn‚Äôt have any external microphone input. Also, the quality<br>
lacks when lights are dim. You can do a lot with the onboard settings, but overall, I expected a bit more. THe price<br>
is ok. Around 250 EUR.</p>
<p>The cool thing is, though, that you can record hours of material next to streaming it to your laptop. Which means<br>
I always have a video backup should anything crash on the laptop.</p>
<p>My friend <a href="https://twitter.com/rstropek">Rainer</a> uses a <a href="https://amzn.to/2LGdlOn">Sony FDR-AX33</a>. This one has an audio jack for an external microphone, and the quality is supreme. It also costs a lot more, this one is sold for 500 EUR.</p>
<p>But hey, check out the quality in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umJE9my_Aeg">one of Rainer‚Äôs videos</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>External microphone possible üëç</li>
<li>Does need CamLink üëé</li>
</ul>
<h2>The DSLR</h2>
<p>DSLRs are not camcorders or video recorders. They are not there to record lengthy videos, and most of them<br>
stop after 15 minutes due to some taxation issues. But: They are available. Either you or one of your relatives<br>
could have one and they create <em>great</em> shots.</p>
<p>I would not recommend buying one extra for streaming, because they are expensive. Around 500-800 EUR just<br>
for the camera, and then you have to invest in lenses. The Canon EOS series allows for external microphones,<br>
but is hard to use with CamLink.</p>
<p>The Sony cameras (A5100, A6000) don‚Äôt have an external microphone check, but work great with CamLink.<br>
Your choice.</p>
<ul>
<li>External microphone possible üëç</li>
<li>Does need CamLink üëé</li>
</ul>
<h2>The action camera</h2>
<p>Another possibility, somewhere inbetween Camcorder and DSLR, is a <a href="https://amzn.to/2YnHFTI">GoPro action camera</a>. They<br>
are affordable (<a href="https://amzn.to/2YpT3P1">180EUR</a> to 350 EUR), and have great accessories. There‚Äôs an adapter for <a href="https://amzn.to/2OiwF6t">10 EUR for an external microphone</a>.</p>
<p>The video is not typically conference like, but you might like that.</p>
<ul>
<li>External microphone possible üëç</li>
<li>Does need CamLink üëé</li>
</ul>
<h2>The iPhone</h2>
<p>There‚Äôs another possibility that has popped up: The iPhone. Elgato (the people behind CamLink), released<br>
<a href="https://www.elgato.com/de/gaming/screen-link">Stream Link for 11 EUR</a>. This, together with the <a href="https://www.elgato.com/de/gaming/game-capture-software">Game Capture Studio</a> allows you to stream your iPhone camera (or screen!) to your<br>
PC. It requires <em>great</em> WiFi, thought. Don‚Äôt be fooled, it‚Äôs nowhere as stable as good old plugs. But it might be an<br>
option if your laptop hardware and the WiFi you have is strong enough to support this. And: an external microphone is<br>
possible. Great!</p>
<p>Other than that: There‚Äôs a possibility to connect your phone with CamLink and use it as a camera. Sweet.</p>
<ul>
<li>External microphone possible üëç</li>
<li>Does not need CamLink üëç</li>
</ul>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Lots of options, all of them good, all of them different. They might suit your situation or your<br>
budget, or you might not produce the results you wish to achieve. Make sure the hardware selected is<br>
suitable for your everyday need.</p>
<p>If you don‚Äôt use an external webcam, almost all solutions are able to have an external microphone<br>
(if you select the right model), and need CamLink. They differ in quality, budget, and availability.</p>
<p>This is the setup so far:</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/streaming-6.png" alt="The streaming setup"></p>
<ul>
<li>2 extra HDMI cables (we assume that there is one available from the projector)</li>
<li>An HDMI splitter</li>
<li>1-2 CamLinks</li>
<li>A webcam (or similar)</li>
<li>Your streaming notebook</li>
</ul>
<h2>Money spent so far</h2>
<p>You have a ton of options that are all cheaper than a pro camera. But they produce different results. If you do a<br>
lot of streaming, I‚Äôd recommend investing in a Sony camcorder with an external microphone jack, and CamLink. Another CamLink costs another 130 EUR. Don‚Äôt forget to add that amount to your calculations.<br>
If you are for the most affordable one, let‚Äôs buy a Logitech Webcam on sale and a tripod:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/2OqUpoK">Tripod (Amazon)</a>: 30 EUR</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/30PFwh6">Logitech C920</a>: 70 EUR on sale</li>
</ul>
<p>100 EUR. Together with 190 EUR from the first chapter, we spent <strong>290 EUR</strong> to stream.</p>
