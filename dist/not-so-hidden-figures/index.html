    <p>I met Laura from <a href="http://foundation.travis-ci.org">Travis Foundation</a> a couple of years ago at a conference in Austria, and we had some good time and nice chats together. It’s not easy to keep always in touch with everyone you meet a conference, but thankfully Laura and I managed to cross paths mutliple times in the last few years. I was also delighted to work with her on bringing diversity tickets to Script’17. After attending Script’17, she asked me to write about my experiences in organizing and getting such a wonderful line-up on stage. Laura was super patient, as it took me about six months to finally get the piece done. But here it is, finally!
