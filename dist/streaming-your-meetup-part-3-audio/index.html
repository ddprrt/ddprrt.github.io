    <p>We successfully set up the projector in the <a href="/streaming-your-meetup-part-1-projector/">first chapter</a>.<br>
We are able to record the speaker‚Äôs video as described in the <a href="/streaming-your-meetup-part-2-video/">second chapter</a>.<br>
Now let there be sound!</p>

<p>There are a ton of options for sound, let‚Äôs make sure your speakers sound great!</p>

<h2>A few words before we start</h2>
<p>I focus mainly on providing sound for one speaker at a time. I will list some options on how to deal<br>
with multiple speakers if you choose a certain scenario.</p>
<p>I also try to find solutions that work with an audio jack solution. An audio jack like you might have on<br>
your notebook or similar. Also, some cameras allow standard audio cables to be plugged in.</p>
<p>If your camera has an audio in for external audio, this is always the preferred way. When you transport<br>
the camera signal to your laptop (either via Webcam or CamLink), the sound is always in tune with the<br>
images. No need to fine-tune it later on.</p>
<p>Also, audio is a beast. Don‚Äôt be worried if you don‚Äôt get TV interview quality for your live event.<br>
The solutions shown in this guide are good enough for your meetup.</p>
<p>Ready? Let‚Äôs check our first option.</p>
<h2>The 6m lapel microphone</h2>
<p>This is actually the cheapest solution: A 6 meter long lapel microphone, just like the<br>
<a href="https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B01M4J5WCM/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1638&amp;creative=6742&amp;creativeASIN=B01M4J5WCM&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=buecherplausc-21&amp;linkId=c41dc5980b2a315eb01e0150a02404dc">MAONO (Amazon)</a><br>
lapel microphone.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs two things why I think this is an awesome idea:</p>
<ol>
<li>Lapel microphones are very closely located to the speaker. This means that you get a<br>
good sound from the speaker with little inferences from the surroundings</li>
<li>6 meters are a lot. The speaker can freely move, and since you are close enough<br>
to them anyway it doesn‚Äôt hinder them a lot when moving.</li>
</ol>
<p>Also, they are cheap! A good lapel microphone is around 25 EUR. It comes with its own<br>
power supply in case you need it, and is pluggable via standard audio jacks.</p>
<p>If you have two speakers, there‚Äôs also a version with two <a href="https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B075H35NGN/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=buecherplausc-21&amp;camp=1638&amp;creative=6742&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B075H35NGN&amp;linkId=e5342ad3d18e36f551a3934ce2cd559f">lapel microphones for the same price</a>. It‚Äôs a lot harder to get one continuous sound level, though.<br>
But it works really fine!</p>
<p>If you need an example of how recording with a 6m lapel microphone sounds, check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jscPbqy-W-M&amp;">this video from Stahlstadt.js</a><br>
or with the dual microphone at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlszvLLMc4Q&amp;t=4565s">.NET Meetup</a>. Listen<br>
how it adapts to the different surroundings.</p>
<h2>The RODE Filmmaker kit</h2>
<p>You can also go wireless! A really, really good wireless lapel microphone is the<br>
<a href="https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B00TV90DX0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1638&amp;creative=6742&amp;creativeASIN=B00TV90DX0&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=buecherplausc-21&amp;linkId=dbef02a20a363103cc968caa750832dc">RODE filmmaker kit</a>.<br>
It‚Äôs also a lapel microphone, but comes with a transmitter and receiver, that can be<br>
easily plugged in your camera or laptop. It has the same implications as a standard lapel<br>
microphone, but the speaker are not attached in any way to your recording setup, which is<br>
always a plus. It‚Äôs a bit costy, though: It‚Äôs around 300 EUR. But some say it‚Äôs totally worth<br>
the money.</p>
<p>Rainer (I featured him in the previous article) is using this one. Check out his talk<br>
on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3o0Qm62hhg">Azure Container Registry</a>. Wonderful sound.<br>
See also how he is using a headset microphone from the venue, but is still wearing the lapel<br>
mic on his collar. Nobody says you can‚Äôt combine those two!</p>
<p>It‚Äôs hard though to get two speakers connected. You would need an additional tool. Like the<br>
Zoom H6.</p>
<h2>The Zoom H6</h2>
<p>It‚Äôs more a tool like a ful-fledged microphone: The <a href="https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B00E0HAQOE/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=buecherplausc-21&amp;camp=1638&amp;creative=6742&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B00E0HAQOE&amp;linkId=66ab2b32eb5068e50bd7db390ff8b5ad">Zoom H6</a>. The Zoom H6 is a little mixer and recorder where<br>
you can plug XLR (or 1/4 inch audio connectors) and either record, or transmit via audio cable<br>
or USB to your laptop.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs pictured above. I use it for podcasting, and it allows me to record 6 invidual tracks that<br>
I can mix later on. But how does this help with streaming? Well, if you are at a location that<br>
has an audio setup themselves (with proper headsets, a proper mixer and all), you normally<br>
can lead the audio signal not only to the speakers, but also to your small mixer. Ask your<br>
host if they have cables for that.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/streaming-8.jpg" alt="A mixer"></p>
<p>With that, you get A+ sound at almost no effort. The Zoom H&amp; costs around 250 to 400 EUR, and<br>
is totally worth it if you do a lot with audio.</p>
<p>Check out the audio of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hAyXU1yfVDM">this recording</a>. Crystal clear.</p>
<p>Since you have 4 plugs, you can connect either 4 lapel microphones (even MAONO, which makes it 8 speakers in total),<br>
or different sources to the Zoom, and get everything to your laptop.</p>
<p>Highly recommended if your location is suited for that.</p>
<p>You can also mount the Zoom H6 on a regular tripod and attach a directional microphone on it. The<br>
microphone is part of the Zoom H6 and makes a kick-ass sound. This might also be a good<br>
alternative for your if you don‚Äôt want to invest in another microphone.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Audio can be rough, but I think the options above provide a good baseline. I‚Äôd go for the lapel<br>
microphone regardless, as it is cheap and you can use it also with the Zoom H6 if you want to<br>
level up at some point.</p>
<p>This is the setup so far:</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/streaming-9.png" alt="The streaming setup"></p>
<ul>
<li>2 extra HDMI cables (we assume that there is one available from the projector)</li>
<li>An HDMI splitter</li>
<li>1-2 CamLinks</li>
<li>A webcam (or similar)</li>
<li>Your streaming notebook</li>
<li>A MAONO 6 meter Lapel microphone</li>
</ul>
<h2>Money spent so far</h2>
<p>The MAONO lapel microphone is set. If you want to level up at some point, consider both options,<br>
especially the Zoom H&amp; as it‚Äôs an essential tool for any audio needs that exceed recording one<br>
voice.</p>

</ul>
<p>Together with 290 EUR from the previous chapter, we spent <strong>315 EUR</strong> to stream.</p>
