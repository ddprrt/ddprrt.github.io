<h2>Carousels You now carousel sliders? Almost every webpage nowadays has one of those...</h2>

{% highlight javascript %}/* 
Here I am standing on my own
Not a motion from the telephone
I know not a reason why
Solitudes a reason to die

Aren't you feeling alone?

I guess its just another
I guess its just another
I guess its just another night alone
