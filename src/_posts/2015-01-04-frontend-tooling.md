I happen to hold my third iteration of the "Frontend Tooling with Grunt and Yeoman" workshop at this years  <a href="http://javascript-days.de/2015/">JavaScript Days</a> in March. It's in Munich, so if you happen to be bear this lovely town, drop by and learn a lot about different JavaScript technologies.

This year, they also have track soley dedicated to <a href="http://angularjs-days.de">Angular JS</a>, held by my friends over at <a href="http://symetics.de">Symetics</a>.

Also, a bunch of friends are there, including Jens Grochtdreis and Peter Kr√∂ner. I really look forward to see them again.

If you're curious what's in with my half-day workshop, feel free to take a look at the slides from the last year's iteration. I constantly keep updating the contents to the current eco-system (also including some Gulp), plus giving a good look at the things to come:

<div class="aspect ratio-4-to-3">
	<iframe class="speakerdeck-iframe" frameborder="0" src="//speakerdeck.com/player/a8a16290885c01318895164c1d05617a?" allowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true"></iframe>
</div>

And if you happen to stay a tad longer in Munich, we might see each other at the <a href="http://www.braukunst-live.com/home/">beer festival</a> the day after.

If you want the workshop for the guys at your office and in private, don't hesitate to <a href="stefan@caped.at">e-Mail me</a>.
