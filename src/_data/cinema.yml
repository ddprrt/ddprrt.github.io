  title: A summer of Rust
  youtubeId: LjFM8vw3pbU
  speaker: Bryan Cantrill
  description: I can listen to Bryan Cantrill for hours. Gladly, he speaks for hours. He wants to speak about Rust, he basically speaks about every programming language from 1993 onwards. Highly entertaining.

  description: "After Ashley McNamara asked about the best tech talks that we've ever seen. This was the first one that sprung into my mind."

  title: Building cloud-native applications with Kubernetes and Istio
  youtubeId: 6BYq6hNhceI
  speaker: Kelsey Hightower
  description: "Every time I look for keynote speakers for DevOne, I end up with Kelsey's phenomenal keynote at Velocity. Incedribly engaging and approachable. This taught me what Kubernetes is actually about. I'm not sure how I feel that O'Reilly has dropped all conferences due to COVID-19, forever! Their content was sometimes extraordinary."

  title: Why your private cloud is probably a bad idea
  speaker: Sam Newman
  youtubeId: MbaPtzSuQII
  description: I've been trying to get Sam to one of my conferences for ages. And this video again shows why. With a certain tongue-in-cheek humor he tells us why Kubernetes is to blame for people picking a private cloud over a public one of the big three cloud players, and gives valid reason why someone shouldn't do their cloud stuff on their own. Fun session!

  title: Design Microservice Architectures the Right Way
  speaker: Michael Bryzek
  twitter: mbryzek
  youtubeId: j6ow-UemzBc
  description: Michael starts with tons of misconceptions around microservices and microservice architectures, and gives some valuable insights on what they needed to create to make microservice architectures really work. This is maybe eye-opening for a lot of people.

  speaker: Manuel Wieser

  youtubeId: lZnz46a58_Y
  description: Manuel shared his isolation story at one of our meetups, and he told us how he tried to make DOOM work in the browser. A wonderful developer journey where he shows how he came to his solution one step at a time. It's also so much fun! And he shows how similar C development is to Front-End development. Kudos!

  title: Static Sites, Dynamic microservices, & Azure
  youtubeId: EpYYe6aQjJM
  speaker: Dan Fernandez
  description: The Jamstack story behind Microsoft Docs. When I was working on the Dynatrace docs, the Microsoft Azure docs evolved in parallel, based on the same tech-stack, and with the same mindset. Whenever people doubted our choice of architecture was right (mostly because it was so fundamentally different from everything they knew), the MS Docs were a good big brother to point to, to make them rethink. Dan gives a full tour on what it means to develop a beast like the Microsoft Docs on the Jamstack, and there's lots of similaritires to what we did, but also lots of new stuff that's so unique and wonderful for their special use-case. Jumping from examples to a fully working Azure shell is simply amazing. Great, great stuff.

  title: I pressed âŒ˜B, you never know what happened next
  youtubeId: kVD-sjtFoEI
  speaker: Marcin Wichary
  description: I love talks by Marcin and had the privilege to see him live a couple of times. This talk is about bold fonts. And all the variations they can have. It's a mess, but presented so funny and engaging that you not only learn a lot, but see regular tasks on typography in a slightly different light. Highly recommended. It's a joy to watch!

  title: Microservice Pipeline Architecture
  youtubeId: vUCr1oTtaKA
  speaker: Tim Perry
  description: You might think that JAMstack and incremental pre-rendering is something entirely new, possibly an invention of a completely new category of websites. Or maybe it's something people have done ever since. Under different names. With different focus. This is software engineering. Nothing is ever new! Tim's talk is a wonderful example of creating a cloud-based architecture for massively scalable websites! Long before *JAMstack* was a name. I wonder why I haven't seen this talk of you, Tim! We've been at least at two conferences together were you gave it!

  title: Building the new Facebook
  youtubeId: KT3XKDBZW7M
  speaker: Ashley Watkins
  description: I really don't like Facebook. I have an account, but I'm not using it. And I stay away from it as much as possible. I like good engineering stories, though! And Ashley's story is one of those! Starting with a regular architecture presentation, going a great deal into micro-optimizations. Wow!

  title: In defense of Utility First CSS
  youtubeId: R50q4NES6Iw 
  speaker: Sarah Dayan
  description: Debunking some myths about atomic/utility-first CSS. Atomic CSS development always got a bad rep, so it's really interesting to see how it now becomes so incredibly popular. One reason might be that people now know how to talk about it, and Sarah's talk is one of the best ones.

  title: Reactive dynamic forms
  youtubeId: 3xwxlHqrLsE
  speaker: Juri Strumpflohner
  description: Juri gives a great intro to NGX Formly (see [formly.dev](https://formly.dev)), an Angular library for dynamic forms. You have use cases like that way too often when you do settings-heavy pages. So it's nice to see a really good generic solution for that. Wonder how this is solved in other frameworks.

  title: Stateful Serverless Applications

  description: Debunking some misconceptions about the internal workings of lambdas. Highly recommended if you work with [Now](https://zeit.co), Azure or AWS.

  title: The return of Write Less, Do more
  youtubeId: BzX4aTRPzno
  speaker: Rich Harris
  description: The only introduction to Svelte that you ever need. And holy template compiler, Batman! Rich is a fantastic storyteller. The amount of detail he puts into his talks is astounding. His delivery feels like watching JavaScript fairy tales. Astounding!

  description: Sandi shows why object-oriented code doesn't have to be a nightmare. I usually don't do a lot of OO, but this one still got me.

  title: Building a resilient front-end architecture
  youtubeId: TqfbAXCCVwE
  speaker: Monica Lent
  description: I deal with a lot of software architecture these days, reading tons of articles and books, and most of them are over-blown, over-complicated, and quite arrogant views on Software Engineering. Not Monica. Monica gives a fun, engaging, and immensely useful talk on architecture. Tips that you can put to use immediately. I could listen to her for lots more hours, I have the feeling that she just started sharing her architecture knowledge.

  title: Write accessible Go
  youtubeId: cVaDY0ChvOQ
  speaker: Julia Ferraioli
  description: "I love accessibility talks, especially some that go into totally different directions. This one by Julia is about writing code that's better to experience for people with visual impairments. I love this talk! Especially since the old rule prevails: If your product (in this case: your code) is accessible for everyone, also people without impairments benefit from it. Good coding guidelines never fail. Julia also does a brilliant delivery. Kudos!"
