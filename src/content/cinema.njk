            As I organize conferences, I watch plenty of conference talks in person and online to seek out new
            talent and craft great programs. Each year I did a list with my most favourite talks, until I found out 
            that it's not only super hard for me to pick the top 5, but also I lose track of many great conference
            talks that I thoroughly enjoy.
          </p>

            So everytime I find a talk that I really, really like, or that I find noteworthy, I list it here. Enjoy the show!
