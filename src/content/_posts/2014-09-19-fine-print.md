This one gets overlooked the most, I guess. If you have any legal disclaimer, a so called fine print or small print (The ambitious "Kleingedruckte" in German), there is actually an element for that, that you might even know: `small`. You may put it in a footer to separate it correctly:

```html
<footer>
 <small>Blah blah blargh disclaimer</small>
</footer>
```

Do not use it for presentational context anymore (then again, it ain't 1999).
