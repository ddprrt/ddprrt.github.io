Me, the author of fettblog.eu, and all contributors and peers stand in solidarity with the Black community, today and every day.

Here's what you can do:
1. Educate yourself. Go to [blacklivesmatter.carrd.co](https://blacklivesmatter.carrd.co/) to find resources, petitions, foundations and donation points. 
2. Follow people from the Black (tech) community and *listen*. Following people like [Pariss Athena](https://mobile.twitter.com/ParissAthena), [Angie Jones](https://mobile.twitter.com/techgirl1908), [Kim Crayton](https://mobile.twitter.com/KimCrayton1), [Chris Nwamba](https://mobile.twitter.com/codebeast) helped me a lot.
3. Give Black people a voice. Retweet, retweet, retweet. Show your peers and followers what's happening to our Black friends. Raise awareness.
4. [Be an ally](https://guidetoallyship.com/).

Black lives matter.
