You might have heard of my [React + TypeScript](/typescript-react/) guide, a rather popular section on this blog. I created this while I was learning both technologies, and I still find it handy as a reference. Recently I switched a lot of my work to [Preact](https://preactjs.com), as it's smaller, faster, and features TypeScript types out of the box.

I thought it might be a good idea to have all the TypeScript gotchas explained for Preact as well, that's why I rewrote my React + TypeScript guide for Preact. This is an extensive rewrite. It's more focussed, it features a lot more examples, and it's on the official Preact.js documentation! Check it out and let me know what you think!
