If you enjoyed [Low Maintenance Types](/low-maintenance-types-typescript/), you might light this new article over at [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/01/dynamic-static-typing-typescript/). In this 4000 words article, I try to type the `get` function of an Express.js-style server, going from no type-support at all to dynamic parsing of path parameters!

It was a lot of fun writing this piece, and it showcases very well the many lessons you learn in my book [TypeScript in 50 Lessons](https://typescript-book.com). Be sure to check it out and head over to Smashing Magazine!
