I'm so incredibly happy to have my first article published on [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/08/using-a-static-site-generator-at-scale-lessons-learned/). It's a
6000 word long story about how we managed to bring roughly 2000 pages on a technology stack made for hackers. It took me
roughly four years to find a story that I'm eager enough to pursue, but in the end I think it totally paid off.
Working with Smashing Magazine, especially Vitaly and Iris, was a complete joy! Thank you again for the professional and
friendly work experience!

So everyone, [enjoy the read](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/08/using-a-static-site-generator-at-scale-lessons-learned/) and let me know what you think!
