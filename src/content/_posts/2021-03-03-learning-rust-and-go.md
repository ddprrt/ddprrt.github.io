My blog is a testament on learning new things. Most of the articles I write are notes on how I solved problems that I found in my every day work. And every now and then I have to urge to learn something new!

Due to my overall weariness with web development in general, I decided to go back to what I did 15-20 years ago, and do some native systems-level programming again. Learning two programming languages in parallel!

It's interesting how both Go and Rust fall into the same category, but are so fundamentally different in design, philosphy, and execution.

Here's what I think about both.

## Hey, ho, let's Go!

My friend Rainer has called Go "Coding Detox". And this is a very fitting term, because you have to unlearn a lot of cruft programming languages added in the last couple of years. Your code becomes more verbose, but inevitably also a lot more readable.

And it's true! Even if you don't know how to write Go, if you have a little bit of knowledge from other programs, you will be able to read Go code. It's that simple.

I like this fact about Go alot. The way Go works *by design* is very similar to how I write JavaScript. So for me, it's very easy to hop on. The reduced syntax allows to focus more on the things that actually matter: Structure, architecture, performance.
