I've written a new book! On **October 6**, the pre-release of [*TypeScript in 50 Lessons*](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/printed-books/typescript-in-50-lessons/) started.  It's 450 pages, published by the wonderful people at [Smashing Magazine](https://smashingmagazine.com), and available to read right now! The printed version is being produced as I write, and will be shipping in mid-November.

It's what it says on the cover: TypeScript. 50 Lessons. All you need to know to become an expert in TypeScript.
*TypeScript in 50 Lessons* has been written with longevity in mind. We focus on the type system, and give you a mental model so you are prepared for all future TypeScript releases. And this is how it came to be...

## The itch...

*TypeScript in 50 Lessons* started all the way back in 2019. My [TypeScript + React guide](https://fettblog.eu/typescript-react/) gained some popularity, just enough to bring acquisition editors of several publishing houses into my mailbox, wanting me to write about TypeScript. There were renowned publishers among them, and also some infamous companies that shoot for quantity, rather than quality.

People reaching out to you to write a book is not uncommon. Especially not if you have material published already, like on a blog, or on Slideshare. This also happened when I wrote my first book [Front-End Tooling](/the-gulp-book/), which was largely based on a workshop I've given in 2014 and 2015.

Compared to *Front-End Tooling*, the amount of publishers reaching out was significantly higher. A handful, but still: I got an e-Mail every week from a different person. All publishers had one thing in common: They were in a hurry. They wanted me to write about TypeScript, yes. But either they had an outline ready and wanted me to contribute a couple of chapters. Or they had a title ready and wanted me to fill it with content in the next couple of months. 

I guess, this isn't so uncommon either. You all know how fast web technologies move. How quickly new things appear and tried and trusted things go into oblivion. Tech book publishers must be frightened on how soon books might become outdated. I know from experience! *Front-End Tooling* was written within 9 months, but it took another year until it was published. I wrote [The announcement post](/the-gulp-book/) in August 2015, the print version appeared at my doorstep in January 2017. *Front-End Tooling* was yesterday's news when it was finally published.

I love *Front-End Tooling*, and I think its concepts and ideas are valid to this day -- the chapters on objects streams and promises haven't aged a bit! But it sobered my view on publishing books. It was a tremendous effort from many people to bring this piece to paper -- was it worth it?

That's why I respectfully declined all offers to write a TypeScript book. But one thing happened: I was stung by the idea of writing a TypeScript book. Oh, and it was itching ... a lot!

## The pitch!

By the beginning of 2019 I spent so much time with TypeScript and its type system that I developed a **mental model**. A map to navigate the type space! Something that would make good learning material. Slides, blog posts. Or maybe something bigger? The mails I got from the acquisition editors were the last push I needed to develop this idea into an outline. And finally to pitch it to a publisher. 

I said to myself to write another book only under two conditions:

1. The book has to have a certain longevity. TypeScript is a hot topic, no doubt. But I don't want to write about the most recent version or explain each feature that ever existed. I want to write a book that isn't outdated even if the TypeScript team releases four versions a year, which they do!
2. It has to have a certain visual appeal. Beautiful typography. Wonderful artworks. A unique experience! I realised over the years that I find it increasingly difficult to focus on text if fonts don't play well with another, and if line lenghts are too wide or to narrow. I had to ditch some undoubtetly good books just because my eyes weren't able to grasp the looks of a typeface, or the way they publishers work with their typeface. Also, I had some ideas on how a TypeScript book can be a unique experience for readers. Something that transcends from a piece of paper into a developer's everyday work environment: The code editor.

Condition number two lead me to a publisher I love since basically forever: [Smashing Magazine](https://smashingmagazine.com). I have every release in my book shelf, even if I'm not the targeted audience. Their books are a joy to read, both visually and content-wise. And they care so much about every little detail to make every book and outstanding experience. 

When I wrote Vitaly, then-editor-in-chief of *Smashing Magazine*, and a frequent collaborator, and pitched my idea, we quickly found that condition number one is a requirement for them to release any book at all. Smashing usually doesn't produce books on JavaScript or programming, as the techniques and technologies become outdated way to quickly. If they release a book based on a programming language, well, then it has to guarantee a certain longevity.

Sounds like a match made in heaven!
