You rarely learn Advanced TypeScript features just by themselves. Only when combined with other parts of the language and put in context they reveal their true power. That's why I created a new guide. An updated collection of articles you can find on this site. Clustered by use-cases, detailing which technologies you use to achieve your goal. 

While each article stands on its own I can recommend reading it like a book, as you see familiar concepts in a new light. And, as said: It's constantly updated. If an article from this site falls into one of the categories, you will find a link -- and the right position to read up on it -- in this guide. Happy reading!
