<h2>How I use your data</h2>

<p>
  Hey, I don't collect nor store any data from you. I don't use any cookies, 
  trackers or anything else that might haunt you someplace else.
  The only cookie you find is from Cloudflare, they use it to make sure you can
   access pages even when you are in a malicious network. 
   See their <a href="https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200170156-What-does-the-Cloudflare-cfduid-cookie-do-">cookie information</a> 
   for details.
</p>

<p>
  Also, I embed YouTube videos on some pages. The moment you enter that papge, YouTube drops their cookies. To make it easier for
  you, I only embed YouTube videos in the <a href="/cinema/">cinema section</a> from now on.
