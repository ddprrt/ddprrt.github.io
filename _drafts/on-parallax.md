What most web folk understand under *Parallax Scrolling* are websites which feature a lot of movements, transitions and transformations initiated on scrolling input by the user. I'm pretty sure you've seen those huge presentations where sunglasses are flying through the air, breaking rocks, assembling and disassembling themselves; sites which make your CPU fan audible and crash your browser in the end. In short: sites just **everybody** loves. Except developers. And visitors.

A lot of those presentations want too much and deliver a unsatisfying user experience. Especially on low end systems which differ from the Macbook extravaganza designers and the marketing staff are going to use.


## Rediscovering Parallax

Before we continue we should take a look back where *Parallax Scrolling* actually originated. Back in the late eighties and nineties, at the second or maybe third hey-day of video games, some smart guys thought of the possible benefits those extra power of 16-bit systems could offer for their gaming presentations.

They created an effect where they put different 2D layers on top of each other, and moving them at different speeds, thus creating some sense of depth where everything was just plain and flat. Even today this technique is used by many games which don't feature a *real* 3D environment.

The screenshot above should showcase that technique. It's a sample from a fairly recent game called *The Whispered World*, which I love. Image each of those planes being projected to the screen. Position changes of the scene will ensure that the layers in the back are moving faster than layers in the front.

## Parallax scrolling sites: Not parallax

## CSS only parallax

Some days ago [Keith Clarke](https://twitter.com/keithclarkcouk) showed us a CSS only technique for parallax scrolling. And besides being just done in CSS and thus not trying to re-implement browser features, it's approach is just pure beauty.
